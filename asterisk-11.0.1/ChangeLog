2012-11-05  Asterisk Development Team <asteriskteam@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 11.0.1 Released.

	* Fix a bug which made ConfBridge not record conferences when the
	  record command was initiated from AMI/CLI commands

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20601)
	  Reported by: Vilius

	* Fix a bug causing SIP reloads to remove all entries from the registry

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20611)
	  Reported by: Alisher

	* Fix an issue with res_http_websocket where the chan_sip WebSocket
	  handler could not be registered.

	  On some systems the optional API support uses the GCC compiler
	  attribute "weakref" to provide its functionality. This code changes
	  the function names and prefixes "__" to the front. The
	  res_http_websocket exports file did not take this into account,
	  thereby not allowing those functions to be global and ultimately
	  found.

	* Asterisk 11.0.0 Released.

2012-10-17  Asterisk Development Team <asteriskteam@digium.com>

	* Asterisk 11.0.0-rc2 Released.

	* [r374792] Fix segfault regression from r370681

	  Due to usage of ast_hook_send_action, AMI action handling code should
	  be able to handle a NULL mansession->session.  This would cause a
	  crash	on NULL dereference if action_originate was called from
	  ast_hook_send_action.

  	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20544)

	* [r374842] Don't make chan_sip export global symbols.

	  During testing, it was discovered that having chan_sip export global
	  symbols was problematic.

	  The biggest problem was that load order was affected.
	  Trying to use realtime could be problematic since in
	  all likelihood the necessary realtime driver(s) would
	  not be loaded before chan_sip.

	  In addition, it was found that it was impossible to
	  use the Digium Phone Module for Asterisk since it
	  must be loaded before chan_sip since it must hook
	  into chan_sip's configuration parsing.

	  The solution is to use a virtual table in the same
	  manner that other modules in Asterisk do, like
	  app_voicemail.

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20545)

	* [r374850] Fix an issue where outgoing calls would fail to establish
	  audio due to ICE negotiation failures.

	  This change removes the requirement for ufrag and pwd in the transport
	  stanza and also makes us the controlling agent.

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20554)
	  Reported by: mmichelson

	* [r374851] Remove code that should not have gotten in (r374850)

	  (issue ASTERISK-20554)

	* [r374877] Fix a bug where audio on Google Voice would not work due to
	  ignoring candidates.

	  Instead of ignoring parts of the message that are not known just
	  ignore the ones we know may be present and that would cause a problem.

	* [r375148] Ensure Asterisk fails TCP/TLS SIP calls when certificate
	  checking fails

	  When placing a call to a TCP/TLS SIP endpoint whose certificate is not
	  signed by a configured CA certificate, Asterisk would issue a warning
	  and continue to process the call as if there was not an issue with the
	  certificate.  Asterisk now properly fails the call if the certificate
	  fails verification or if the certificate does not exist when
	  certificate checking is enabled (the default behavior).

	  (closes issue ASTERISK-20559)

	  call-id logging development.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, configs/rtp.conf.sample: Disable ICE
	  support by default Since there are a number of legacy devices out
	  there that fail to handle ICE candidates properly (which is a

	  issues in ConfBridge regarding marked, waitmarked, and unmarked
	  users Thank's to Neil Tallim (flan)'s tireless testing, issue
	  reporting, and patches it became clear that app_confbridge had
	  some complex logic in how it handled interactions between marked,
	  waitmarked, and unmarked users. In particular, there were some
	  areas in which the interactions between the users resulted in
	  inconsistent behavior, and app_confbridge was missing logic in
	  how to handle some corner cases. Some areas included: * Poor
	  handling of mixing unmarked and waitmarked users *
	  Inconsistencies in how MOH and muting was applied to various
	  users * Handling of various announcements for different user
	  profile options flan's patches seem to fix the various issues,
	  but highlighted how hard the code could be to maintain. In an
	  attempt to make things easier to maintain and to more fully
	  enumerate the various cases that exist, this patch breaks up the
	  logic into a state machine-like setup. Please note that the
	  various state transitioned are documented on the Asterisk wiki:

	  22 lines Improve AMI long line error handling In AMI's parser,

	* /, res/res_jabber.c: Check for presence of buddy in info/dinfo
	  handlers The res_jabber resource module uses the ASTOBJ library
	  for managing its ref counted objects. After calling
	  ASTOBJ_CONTAINER_FIND to locate a buddy object, the pointer to
	  the object has to be checked to see if the buddy existed. Prior
	  to this patch, the buddy object was not checked for NULL; with
	  this patch in both aji_client_info_handler and aji_dinfo_handler
	  the pointer is checked before used and, if no buddy object was
	  found, the handlers return an error code. This patch does not
	  take the approach that our JID can be used to log in from another
	  resource. If that approach is desired, an improvement could be
	  made to this patch to create the buddy on the fly. This patch
	  seeks only to prevent Asterisk from crashing. FYI: In Asterisk
	  11+, you really should be using res_xmpp. It does not have this
	  problem, as it moved to the astobj2 library. Note that multiple
	  people have proposed patches for this issue; the patch being
	  committed here is based on those. (closes issue ASTERISK-19532)

	* main/db.c, include/asterisk/astdb.h, /, tests/test_db.c,
	  apps/app_queue.c: app_queue: Support persisting and loading of
	  long member lists. Greenlight in #asterisk brought up that he was
	  receiving an error message "Could not create persistent member
	  string, out of space" when running app_queue in Asterisk 10.
	  dump_queue_members() made an assumption that 8K would be enough
	  to store the generated string, but with queues that have large
	  member lists this is not always the case. This patch removes the
	  limitation and uses ast_str instead of a fixed sized buffer. The
	  complicating factor comes from the fact that ast_db_get requires
	  a buffer and buffer size argument, which doesn't let us pull back
	  more than what we pass in, so I introduced a new
	  ast_db_get_allocated() which returns an ast_strdup()'d copy of
	  the value from astdb. As an aside, I did some testing on the
	  maximum size of data that we can store in the BDB library we
	  distribute and was able to store a 10MB string and retrieve it
	  with no problems, so I feel this is a safe patch. Review:

	  linking the module via load_dynamic_module() but was not adding
	  the module to the resource_heap. Therefore the module was not
	  initialized based on it's priority along with the other modules
	  in the heap. Now use load_resource() instead of
	  load_dynamic_module() for non-optional requirement. This will add
	  the module to the resource_heap so the module can be properly
	  initialized in the correct order. This is required if there are
	  any module global data structures initialized in the .load()
	  callback for the module on platforms which do not support weak

	* channels/chan_local.c, /: Fix T.38 support when used with

	  indicate a T.38 negotiation with the parameters present on the
	  channel. The return value of this indication is expected to be
	  AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS upon success but with chan_local involved
	  this could never occur. This fix changes chan_local to always
	  return AST_T38_REQUEST_PARMS for this situation. If the
	  underlying channel technology on the other side does not support
	  T.38 this would have been determined ahead of time using
	  ast_channel_get_t38_state and an indication would not occur.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix potential reentrancy problems in
	  chan_sip. Asterisk v1.8 and later was not as vulnerable to this
	  issue. * Made find_call() lock each private as it processes the

	  functions that traverse the dialogs container lock each private
	  as it examines them. * Fix race condition in sip_call() if the
	  thread that sent the INVITE is held up long enough for a response
	  to be processed. The p->initid for the INVITE retransmission
	  could be added after it was canceled by the response processing.
	  * Made __sip_destroy() clean up resource pointers after freeing.
	  This is primarily defensive in case someone has a stale private
	  pointer. * Removed redundant memset() in reqprep(). The call to
	  init_req() already does the memset() and is the first reference
	  to req in reqprep(). * Removed useless set of req.method in
	  transmit_invite(). The calls to initreqprep() and reqprep() have
	  to do this because they memset() the req. JIRA ABE-2876

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a deadlock caused by a race condition
	  between removing a hint and reloading the dialplan and
	  subscribing to the removed hint. If conditions were right it was
	  possible for both the PBX core and chan_sip to deadlock by both
	  having a lock that the other wants. In the case of the PBX core
	  it had the contexts lock and wanted a SIP dialog lock, while in
	  the case of chan_sip it had the SIP dialog lock and wanted the
	  contexts lock. This fix unlocks the SIP dialog before getting the
	  extension state so that the other thread will not block on trying
	  to lock it. Once the extension state is retrieved the SIP dialog
	  is locked again and life carries on. As the SIP dialog is
	  reference counted it is not possible for it to go away after
	  unlocking. (closes issue ASTERISK-20437) Reported by: jhutchins

	* channels/chan_sip.c, res/res_format_attr_h264.c: Fix an issue
	  with H.264 format attribute comparison and fix an issue with
	  improper SDP being produced. The H.264 format attribute module
	  compares two format attribute structures to determine if they are
	  compatible or not. In some instances it was possible for this
	  check to determine that both structures were incompatible when
	  they actually should be considered compatible. This check has now
	  been made even more permissive by assuming that if no attribute
	  information is available the two structures are compatible. If
	  both structures contain attribute information a base level
	  comparison of the H.264 IDC value is done to see if they are
	  compatible or not. The above issue uncovered a secondary issue in
	  chan_sip where the SDP being produced would be incorrect if the
	  formats were considered incompatible. This has now been fixed by
	  checking that all information required to produce the SDP is
	  available instead of assuming it is. (closes issue

	  Resolve memory leaks in TLS initialization and TLS client
	  connections This patch resolves two sources of memory leaks when
	  using TLS in Asterisk: 1) It removes improper initialization (and
	  multiple re-initializations) of portions of the SSL library.
	  Asterisk calls SSL_library_init and SSL_load_error_strings during
	  SSL initialization; collectively this obviates the need for
	  calling any of the following during initialization or client
	  connection handling: * ERR_load_crypto_strings (handled by
	  SSL_load_error_strings) * OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) * SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms (synonym for
	  SSL_library_init) 2) Failure to completely clean up all memory
	  allocated by Asterisk and by the SSL library for TLS clients.
	  This included not freeing the SSL_CTX object in the SIP channel
	  driver, as well as not clearing the error stack when the TLS
	  client exited. Note that these memory leaks were found by Thomas
	  Arimont, and this patch was essentially written by him with some

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: res_rtp_asterisk: Eliminate "type-punned
	  pointer" build warning. Removes "res_rtp_asterisk.c:706: warning:
	  dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
	  rules" warning from the build on 32-bit platforms. The problem is
	  that 'size' was referenced aliased to both (pj_size_t *) and
	  (pj_ssize_t *). Now just make a copy of size that is the right
	  type so there isn't any pointer aliasing happening. It also adds
	  comments and asserts regarding what looks like an inappropriate

	* channels/sip/sdp_crypto.c, /: Only re-create an SRTP session when
	  needed In r356604, SRTP handling was fixed to accomodate multiple
	  crypto keys in an SDP offer and the ability to re-create an SRTP
	  session when the crypto keys changed. In certain circumstances -
	  most notably when a phone is put on hold after having been
	  bridged for a significant amount of time - the act of re-creating
	  the SRTP session causes problems for certain models of phones.
	  The patch committed in r356604 always re-created the SRTP session
	  regardless of whether or not the cryptographic keys changed.
	  Since this is technically not necessary, this patch modifies the
	  behavior to only re-create the SRTP session if Asterisk detects
	  that the remote key has changed. This allows models of phones
	  that do not handle the SRTP session changing to continue to work,
	  while also providing the behavior needed for those phones that do
	  re-negotiate cryptographic keys. (issue ASTERISK-20194) Reported

	* /, apps/app_minivm.c: Fix file descriptor leak and pointer scope
	  issue in MiniVM when sending mail When MiniVM sends an e-mail and
	  it has the volgain option set, it will spawn sox in a separate
	  process to handle the manipulation of the sound file. In doing
	  so, it creates a temporary file. There are two problems here: 1)
	  The file descriptor returned from mkstemp is leaked 2) The
	  finalfilename character pointer points to a buffer that loses
	  scope once volgain processing is finished. Note that in r316265,
	  Russell fixed some gcc warnings by using the return value of the
	  mkstemp call. A warning was placed in minivm that the file
	  descriptor was going to be leaked. This patch reverts that
	  change, as it handles the leak and 'uses' the file descriptor

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix issue where SIP devices were not
	  notified when custom devices changed to "ringing". The problem
	  had to do with logic used when checking for what the oldest
	  ringing channel was. The problem was that if no channel was
	  found, then no notification would be sent. For custom device
	  states, there is no associated channel, so no notification would
	  get sent. This fixes the issue by still sending the notification

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: Prevent crash on shutdown due to refcount
	  error on queues container. When app_queue is unloaded, the queues
	  container has its refcount decremented, potentially to 0. Then
	  the taskprocessor responsible for handling device state changes
	  is unreferenced. If the taskprocessor happens to be just about to
	  run its task, then it will create and destroy an iterator on the
	  queues container. This can cause the refcount on the queues
	  container to increase to 1 and then back to 0. Going back to 0 a
	  second time results in double frees. This failure was seen
	  periodically in the testsuite when Asterisk would shut down.

	* main/manager.c, /, README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt:
	  AST-2012-012: Resolve AMI User Unauthorized Shell Access through
	  ExternalIVR The AMI Originate action can allow a remote user to
	  specify information that can be used to execute shell commands on
	  the system hosting Asterisk. This can result in an unwanted
	  escalation of permissions, as the Originate action, which
	  requires the "originate" class authorization, can be used to
	  perform actions that would typically require the "system" class
	  authorization. Previous attempts to prevent this permission
	  escalation (AST-2011-006, AST-2012-004) have sought to do so by
	  inspecting the names of applications and functions passed in with
	  the Originate action and, if those applications/functions matched
	  a predefined set of values, rejecting the command if the user
	  lacked the "system" class authorization. As noted by IBM X-Force
	  Research, the "ExternalIVR" application is not listed in the
	  predefined set of values. The solution for this particular
	  vulnerability is to include the "ExternalIVR" application in the
	  set of defined applications/functions that require "system" class
	  authorization. Unfortunately, the approach of inspecting fields
	  in the Originate action against known applications/functions has
	  a significant flaw. The predefined set of values can be bypassed
	  by creative use of the Originate action or by certain dialplan
	  configurations, which is beyond the ability of Asterisk to
	  analyze at run-time. Attempting to work around these scenarios
	  would result in severely restricting the applications or
	  functions and prevent their usage for legitimate means. As such,
	  any additional security vulnerabilities, where an
	  application/function that would normally require the "system"
	  class authorization can be executed by users with the "originate"
	  class authorization, will not be addressed. Instead, the
	  README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated to
	  reflect that the AMI Originate action can result in commands
	  requiring the "system" class authorization to be executed. Proper
	  system configuration can limit the impact of such scenarios.

	  then pjlib will be referencing bogus data quite often, most
	  commonly on operations involving a pj_mutex_t. In our case, our
	  pj_thread_desc was on the stack and went out of scope very
	  shortly after registering our thread with pjlib. With this

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: rtp: Ensure defaults are set without

	  to be enabled by default, but it was only applied if rtp.conf
	  existed. This patch updates res_rtp_asterisk to be consistent in
	  how it handles defaults. A few options didn't have their default
	  values set globally, including icesupport. They are now set and
	  icesupport is enabled by default, even if you do not have an
	  rtp.conf.

	  main/channel_internal_api.c, main/features.c,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, channels/sig_pri.c,
	  funcs/func_callerid.c, main/cli.c: Add private representation of
	  caller, connected and redirecting party ids. This patch adds the
	  feature "Private representation of caller, connected and
	  redirecting party ids", as previously discussed with us (DATUS)
	  and Digium. 1. Feature motivation Until now it is quite difficult
	  to modify a party number or name which can only be seen by
	  exactly one particular instantiated technology channel
	  subscriber. One example where a modified party number or name on
	  one channel is spread over several channels are supplementary
	  services like call transfer or pickup. To implement these
	  features Asterisk internally copies caller and connected ids from
	  one channel to another. Another example are extension
	  subscriptions. The monitoring entities (watchers) are notified of
	  state changes and - if desired - of party numbers or names which
	  represent the involving call parties. One major feature where a
	  private representation of party names is essentially needed, i.e.
	  where a party name shall be exclusively signaled to only one
	  particular user, is a private user-specific name resolution for
	  party numbers. A lookup in a private destination-dependent
	  telephone book shall provide party names which cannot be seen by
	  any other user at any time. 2. Feature Description This feature
	  comes along with the implementation of additional private party
	  id elements for caller id, connected id and redirecting ids
	  inside Asterisk channels. The private party id elements can be
	  read or set by the user using Asterisk dialplan functions. When a
	  technology channel is initiating a call, receives an internal
	  connected-line update event, or receives an internal redirecting
	  update event, it merges the corresponding public id with the
	  private id to create an effective party id. The effective party
	  id is then used for protocol signaling. The channel technologies
	  which initially support the private id representation with this
	  patch are SIP (chan_sip), mISDN (chan_misdn) and PRI
	  (chan_dahdi). Once a private name or number on a channel is set
	  and (implicitly) made valid, it is generally used for any further
	  protocol signaling until it is rewritten or invalidated. To
	  simplify the invalidation of private ids all internally generated
	  connected/redirecting update events and also all
	  connected/redirecting update events which are generated by
	  technology channels -- receiving regarding protocol information -
	  automatically trigger the invalidation of private ids. If not
	  using the private party id representation feature at all, i.e. if
	  using only the 'regular' caller-id, connected and redirecting
	  related functions, the current characteristic of Asterisk is not
	  affected by the new extended functionality. 3. User interface
	  Description To grant access to the private name and number
	  representation from the Asterisk dialplan, the CALLERID,
	  CONNECTEDLINE and REDIRECTING dialplan functions are extended by
	  the following data types. The formats of these data types are
	  equal to the corresponding regular 'non-private' already existing
	  data types: CALLERID: priv-all priv-name priv-name-valid
	  priv-name-charset priv-name-pres priv-num priv-num-valid

	* main/pbx.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Extend extension state callbacks to
	  have more information. Quote from review board: This patch
	  extends the extension state callbacks so that monitoring channels
	  (as chan_sip) get more information of the devices which are
	  responsible for an extension state change. The additional
	  information is needed by chan_sip to present names/numbers of the
	  caller and callee in an early-state SIP notification. Users of
	  extenstion state callback not interested in the additional
	  information are not affected by the changes. Motivation: to
	  present the involved party's name/number in an early-state
	  nofification (used by the notified device as a pickup offer) one
	  after another so that a user can see which call he will pick up
	  in an undirected pickup. Such a pickup offer to a user shall
	  indicate the same call (number/name-A calls number/name-B) as the
	  call which would be picked up when an undirected pickup is
	  executed. Users interested in additional state info must use the
	  new functions ast_extension_state_add_extended() resp.
	  ast_extension_state_add_destroy_extended() to register an
	  extended state callback. When the callback is registered this
	  way, an extra member device_state_info of struct
	  ast_state_cb_info is passed to the callback in addition to the
	  aggregated extension state. This container holds an object for
	  every device of the monitored extension hint consisting of the
	  device name, the device state and a channel reference to the
	  channel which (presumably) caused the device state. The
	  information is used by chan_sip for early-state notifications.
	  When the state of a device changes and the new state contains
	  AST_EVENT_RINGING, an early-state notification is sent to the
	  subscribed devices with the caller/callee names/numbers of the
	  oldest ringing channel of the monitored extension. The notified
	  user may then invoke a direct pickup, which will pickup exactly
	  this channel. Users of the old non-extended callbacks will only
	  be called when the aggregated state did change (same behavior as
	  before). Users of the extended callback will also be called when
	  the state is unchanged but does contain AST_EVENT_RINGING. That
	  could be the case if two channels are ringing at one device and
	  one of them hangs up, so the aggregated state does not change.
	  This way the monitoring channel can create a new early-state
	  notification with the now ringing party-ids. Review:
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/2048 This contribution comes

	  CHANGES file.

	  apps/app_originate.c, include/asterisk/channel.h,
	  include/asterisk/pbx.h, CHANGES, res/res_clioriginate.c: Allow
	  support for early media on AMI originates and call files. This is
	  based on the work done by Olle Johansson on review board. The
	  idea is that the channel specified in an AMI originate or call
	  file is typically not connected to the outgoing extension until
	  the channel has been answered. With this change, an EarlyMedia
	  header can be specified for AMI originates and an early_media
	  option can be specified in call files. With this option set, once
	  early media is received on a channel, it will be connected with
	  the outgoing extension. (closes issue ASTERISK-18644) Reported by

	  channels/misdn_config.c: Add named callgroups/pickupgroups This
	  patch adds named calledgroups/pickupgroups to Asterisk. Named
	  groups are implemented in parallel to the existing numbered
	  callgroup/pickupgroup implementation. However, unlike the
	  existing implementation, which is limited to a maximum of 64
	  defined groups, the number of defined groups allowed for named
	  callgroups/pickupgroups is effectively unlimited. Named groups
	  are configured with the keywords "namedcallgroup" and
	  "namedpickupgroup". This corresponds to the numbered group
	  definitions of "callgroup" and "pickupgroup". Note that as the
	  implementation of named groups coexists with the existing
	  numbered implementation, a defined named group of "4" does not
	  equate to numbered group 4. Support for the named groups has been
	  added to the SIP, DAHDI, and mISDN channel drivers. Review:

	  SIP dialstring. This is based on the review request posted by
	  Walter Doekes (referenced lower in the commit message) The main
	  fix here is to treat the IPorHost portion of the dial string as a
	  temporary outbound proxy. This ensures requests get sent to the
	  proper location. Due to the age of the request, some parts were
	  no longer relevant. For instance, the request moved outbound
	  proxy parsing code into a single method. This is done in a
	  previous commit, so it was not necessary to do again. Also, the
	  review request fixed some errors with regards to request routing
	  for CANCEL and ACK requests. This has also been fixed in more
	  recent commits. (closes issue ASTERISK-19677) reported by Walter

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Schedule pokes of registered SIP peers
	  within a given timespan after SIP reload With a large number of
	  SIP peers registered, performing a SIP reload causes a flood of
	  SIP OPTIONS request packets. These are immediately sent out, and,
	  as responses come back, can cause peers to be flagged as 'lagged'
	  due to handling of the many response messages. This fix prevents
	  this "packet storm" and schedules the pokes for a random time.
	  That time varies between 1 ms and the peer's qualify time, or, if
	  the qualify time is unknown, the global qualifyfreq setting. The
	  committed patch has some very small modifications to the patch
	  schmidts wrote for the review. (closes issue ASTERISK-19154)

	* main/event.c: Move event cache updates into event processing
	  thread. Prior to this patch, updating the device state cache was
	  done by the thread that originated the event. It would update the
	  cache and then queue the event up for another thread to dispatch.
	  This thread moves the cache updating part to be in the same
	  thread as event dispatching. I was working with someone on a
	  heavily loaded Asterisk system and while reviewing backtraces of
	  the system while it was having problems, I noticed that there
	  were a lot of threads contending for the lock on the event cache.
	  By simply moving this into a single thread, this helped
	  performance *a lot* and alleviated some deadlock-like symptoms.

	* CHANGES, pbx/pbx_config.c: Add "dialplan remove context" and
	  modify "dialplan add include" From corruptor's review board
	  posting: "I've noticed that we can remove particular extension
	  from context with dialplan remove extension command but in order
	  to remove all extensions in the context we should delete them on
	  by one. I've created dialplan remove context command which uses
	  ast_context_destroy to destroy the whole context with all
	  extensions. I've created to functions for in pbx_config.c:
	  handle_cli_dialplan_remove_context which actually removes context
	  and complete_dialplan_remove_context which completes input. They
	  are based on other similar functions and pretty trivial but I can
	  be mistaken somewhere. "I've also modified dialplan add include
	  <context2> into <context1>. I've made it similar dialplan add
	  extension ... command. It creates <context1> if it doesn't exist
	  and I've also modified complete_dialplan_add_include and removed
	  check for existance of <context2> because we can include
	  non-existent context into another one. (I usually include empty
	  (non-existent) contexts in advance). Should we raise warning in
	  this case as it's raised while reading extensions.conf? "I use
	  those functions with AMI. I think manager commands should be
	  created in addition to those CLI commands." I've addressed the
	  latest comments on review board and have made some other coding
	  guidelines-related cleanup. I also have modified the CHANGES file
	  to mention these new commands. (closes issue ASTERISK-19292)

	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Clean up chan_sip This clean up was
	  broken out from https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1976/ and
	  addresses the following: - struct sip_refer converted to use the
	  stringfields API. - sip_{refer|notify}_allocate ->
	  sip_{notify|refer}_alloc to match other *alloc functions. -
	  Replace get_msg_text, get_msg_text2 and get_pidf_body -> No, not
	  get_pidf_msg_text_body3 but get_content, to match add_content. -
	  get_body doesn't get the request body, renamed to
	  get_content_line. - get_body_by_line doesn't get the body line,
	  and is just a simple if test. Moved code inline and removed
	  function. - Remove camelCase in struct sip_peer peer state
	  variables, onHold -> onhold, inUse -> inuse, inRinging ->
	  ringing. - Remove camelCase in struct sip_request rlPart1 ->
	  rlpart1, rlPart2 -> rlpart2. - Rename instances of pvt->randdata
	  to pvt->nonce because that is what it is, no need to update
	  struct sip_pvt because _it already has a nonce field_. - Removed
	  struct sip_pvt randdata stringfield. - Remove useless (and
	  inconsistent) 'header' suffix on variables in
	  handle_request_subscribe. - Use ast_strdupa on Event header in
	  handle_request_subscribe to avoid overly complicated strncmp
	  calls to find the event package. - Move get_destination check in
	  handle_request_subscribe to avoid duplicate checking for packages
	  that don't need it. - Move extension state callback management in
	  handle_request_subscribe to avoid duplicate checking for packages
	  that don't need it. - Remove duplicate append_date prototype. -
	  Rename append_date -> add_date to match other add_xxx functions.
	  - Added add_expires helper function, removed code that manually
	  added expires header. - Remove _header suffix on
	  add_diversion_header (no other header adding functions have
	  this). - Don't pass req->debug to request handle_request_XXXXX
	  handlers if req is also being passed. - Don't pass req->ignore to
	  check_auth as req is already being passed. - Don't create a
	  subscription in handle_request_subscribe if p->expiry == 0. -
	  Don't walk of the back of referred_by_name when splitting string
	  in get_refer_info - Remove duplicate check for no dialog in
	  handle_incoming when sipmethod == SIP_REFER, handle_request_refer
	  checks for that. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1993/

	  event twice. ast_event_new() now always adds it automatically.
	  Previously it only added it if there were no IEs specified, which
	  was kind of weird.

	* include/asterisk/event_defs.h, res/res_corosync.c, main/event.c:
	  Add a "corosync ping" CLI command. This patch adds a new CLI
	  command to the res_corosync module. It is primarily used as a
	  debugging tool. It lets you fire off an event which will cause
	  res_corosync on other nodes in the cluster to place messages into
	  the logger if everything is working ok. It verifies that the
	  corosync communication is working as expected. I didn't put
	  anything in the CHANGES file for this, because this module is new
	  in Asterisk 11. There is already a generic "res_corosync new
	  module" entry in there so I figure that covers it just fine.

	* addons/app_mysql.c, CHANGES: Allow specifying a port number for
	  the MySQL server. This patch allows you to specify a port number
	  for the MySQL server. It's useful if a MySQL server is running on
	  a non-standard port. Even though this module is deprecated in
	  favor of func_odbc, someone asked for this feature and it seems
	  pretty harmless to add. It has been tested using a number of
	  combinations of with/without a port number specified in the
	  dialplan and changing the port number for mysqld.

	* tests/test_abstract_jb.c (added), main/abstract_jb.c,
	  funcs/func_jitterbuffer.c, include/asterisk/abstract_jb.h: Unit
	  tests for the Jitter Buffer API; remove unnecessary resync This
	  patch includes the following: * Unit tests for the abstract
	  Jitter Buffer API. This includes both fixed and adaptive flavors,
	  testing nominal creation, frame input, frame retrieval,
	  resyncing; off nominal frame input overflow, out of order, and
	  others. * Tweaks to the abstract_jb API to remove the unnecessary
	  resync_threshold parameter from the create function
	  (resync_threshold is already in the struct passed into the create
	  function) * Ensure the fixed jitter buffer is empty before
	  destroying it, to avoid an ASSERT * Don't "resync" the adaptive
	  jitter buffer. The mechanism that was being used actually causes
	  the jitter buffer to think its being overflowed by going around
	  the jitterbuf API and attempting to 'resynch' it improperly. If a
	  resync is needed, the jitter buffer will do it properly by
	  itself. Note that this is only an optimization needed for trunk,
	  as the worst that happens is the loss of three voice packets
	  before the adaptive jitter buffer will resync anyway. Review:

	* main/config_options.c, apps/app_confbridge.c,
	  apps/confbridge/conf_config_parser.c: Fix segfault introduced by
	  conversion to ACO API The value "none" is specified in the config
	  file as a valid value for the "video_mode" option. The code prior
	  to the ACO conversion did not check for "none", but just ignored
	  it and relied on the default zero value. The parsing with ACO is
	  more strict, so without handling "none" specifically, parsing
	  would fail. When parsing failed, but the module loaded anyway,
	  the config info would never be stored, and one place in the code
	  did not check for this case and would segfault. It was also
	  possible that the aco_info struct's internals would be destroyed
	  and used as well. This patch keeps the module from loading after
	  parse failures, adds the "none" option to "video_mode", registers
	  CLI functions only after parsing has completed, checks the config
	  data for NULL before accessing it, and returns -1 on some

	* channels/chan_sip.c, res/res_xmpp.c, doc/appdocsxml.dtd,
	  main/message.c, main/xmldoc.c: Add the ability to specify
	  technology specific documentation A number of applications/AMI
	  commands in Asterisk have specific behavioral differences
	  depending on the resource or channel technology those
	  applications are executed on. For example, the MessageSend
	  application/ command is technology agnostic, but how the channel
	  drivers that support that functionality behave is dependant on
	  the protocols and channel driver implementation. Prior to this
	  patch, those details were either documented in the
	  application/command documentation itself, or were left
	  undocumented. This patch adds a new element to the documentation
	  schema, <info/>. An info node is essentially a piece of
	  technology specific reference information that can be included by
	  any top level XML documentation node. For example, the
	  MessageSend application can now include XMPP/SIP specific
	  information, where that technology specific information can be
	  defined in chan_motif/res_xmpp/ chan_sip. Likewise, that
	  information can also be included in the MessageSend AMI command.

	* /, main/cel.c: Fix compilation error when MALLOC_DEBUG is enabled
	  To fix a memory leak in CEL, a channel datastore was introduced

	  ast_free is defined as free. With MALLOC_DEBUG enabled, however,
	  ast_free takes on a definition from a different place then
	  utils.h, and became undefined. This patch resolves this by using
	  a reference to ast_free_ptr. When MALLOC_DEBUG is enabled, this
	  calls ast_free; when MALLOC_DEBUG is not enabled, this is defined
	  to be ast_free, which is defined to be free. (issue AST-916)

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c, /: Handle extremely out of order RFC 2833
	  DTMF The current implementation of RFC 2833 DTMF handling in
	  res_rtp_asterisk will, if a packet arrives out of order, drop the
	  packet. This is to prevent duplicate ton generation in the
	  Asterisk core. Since the RTP layer does not buffer data itself,
	  this is the only option the RTP layer currently has for handling
	  packets that arrive out of order. For the most part, this doesn't
	  matter. For a particular digit, so long as a BEGIN packet arrives
	  before the first END packet, the digit will be produced. If
	  subsequent BEGIN packets arrive interleaved with the ENDs, they
	  will be dropped; likewise, if the BEGIN or END packets themselves
	  are out of order, those packets are dropped but sufficient
	  information is conveyed to the Asterisk core to produce the
	  appropriate digit. For certain sequences of DTMF packets - most
	  notably when, for a particular digit, an END packet arrives
	  before any BEGIN packet for that digit - this is a real problem.
	  When an END arrives before any BEGINs, the END packet is dropped
	  - but at the same time, it causes subsequent BEGIN packets for
	  that digit to be ignored. When the next in order END packet
	  arrives, it too is dropped - Asterisk believes that there was no
	  initial BEGIN. The solution this patch provides is to trust the
	  END packet to convey the information needed for the Asterisk core
	  to produce the DTMF digit. If we receive an END packet, and it: *
	  Has a timestamp greater then the last timestamp received from an
	  END packet * Does not have the same sequence number as the last
	  received sequence number (and is thus not an END packet
	  retransmission) Then we send the END frame up to the Asterisk
	  core. It contains enough DTMF information for Asterisk to produce
	  the digit. On the other hand, if we receive a BEGIN or
	  continuation packet that occurs with a timestamp equal to or less
	  then the last END timestamp, then we've received something out of
	  order - but we already have received enough information to
	  produce the digit. These packets are dropped. Much thanks goes to
	  Olle Johansson (oej) for providing the idea for this solution.

	* /, main/cel.c: Resolve severe memory leak in CEL logging modules.
	  A customer reported a significant memory leak using Asterisk 1.8.

	  ast_cel_fabricate_channel_from_event() in main/cel.c, which is
	  called by both in-tree CEL logging modules (cel_custom.c and
	  cel_sqlite3_custom.c) for each and every CEL event that they log.
	  The cause was an incorrect assumption about how data attached to
	  an ast_channel would be handled when the channel is destroyed;
	  the data is now stored in a datastore attached to the channel,
	  which is destroyed along with the channel at the proper time.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Fix a crash in pjnath when starting an
	  ICE connectivity check and immediately destroying the ICE
	  session. The initial ICE connectivity check is scheduled as a
	  timer item that is to be executed immediately. It is possible for
	  this timer item to start executing while the ICE session it is
	  working on is destroyed. To reduce the chance of this any timer
	  items that need to be immediately executed will be executed
	  within the thread that has started the initial ICE connectivity
	  check.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/rtp_engine.h: Fix a crash
	  occurring as a result of excess stack usage. This fix involves
	  moving the allocation of some temporary codec structures to the
	  heap and also reduces the number of maximum payloads to something
	  more sane for both regular and low memory builds. (closes issue

	* res/res_xmpp.c: Add pubsub unsubscription support so
	  subscriptions do not linger for MWI and device state progatation.
	  The pubsub code did not attempt to remove subscriptions at all.
	  This has now changed so that if a client is being disconnected it
	  will unsubscribe. It will also unsubscribe at connection time so
	  if it unexpectedly disconnected duplicate subscriptions will not
	  occur. (closes issue ASTERISK-19882) Reported by: mattvryan

	* include/asterisk/xmpp.h, res/res_xmpp.c: Fix a crash as a result
	  of propagating MWI or device state over XMPP when the client is
	  disconnected. The MWI and device state propagation code wrongly
	  assumes that an XMPP client connection will remain established at
	  all times. This fix corrects that by making the lifetime of the
	  subscription the same as the lifetime of the connection itself.
	  As the connection is established and disconnected the
	  subscription itself is created and destroyed. (closes issue
	  ASTERISK-18078) Reported by: elguero

	* main/features.c: Don't perform an XInclude to a document node
	  that may not always be present Because some of the manager events

	  colocated with the call itself, several include statements were
	  failing when built with 'make'. While this did not cause any

	  having an AMI event, then the XML fragment associated with the
	  AMI event was erroneously placed in the resulting XML file.
	  Without the python scripts, these XML fragments will not
	  validate. This patch adds DOCUMENTATION tags at the top of those

	  When the OpenSSL duplicate initialization issues were resolved in
	  r351447, res_curl could fail to load if it checked
	  SSL_library_init after SSL initialization completed. This is due
	  to the SSL_library_init stub returning a value of 0 for success,
	  as opposed to a value of 1. OpenSSL uses a value of 1 to indicate
	  success - in fact, SSL_library_init is documented to always
	  return 1. Interestingly, the CURL libraries actually checked the
	  return value - the fact that nothing else that depends on OpenSSL
	  was having problems loading probably means they don't check the

	* main/tcptls.c, /: Remove a superfluous and dangerous freeing of
	  an SSL_CTX. The problem here is that multiple server sessions
	  share a SSL_CTX. When one session ended, the SSL_CTX would be
	  freed and set NULL, leaving the other sessions unable to
	  function. The code being removed is superfluous because the
	  SSL_CTX structures for servers will be properly freed when
	  ast_ssl_teardown is called. (closes issue ASTERISK-20074)

	* /, apps/app_voicemail.c: AST-2012-011: Resolve heap corruption
	  issue with voicemail The heard and deleted arrays in the
	  voicemail state structure were not handled properly following the
	  memory leak fix in r354890 and a fix for an invalid free in
	  r356797. This could result in accessing and writing into freed
	  memory. The allocation for these arrays has been reworked to
	  avoid the possibility of invalid frees, access of freed memory,
	  and crashes that were occurring as a result of this. Locking
	  around accesses and modifications of the voicemail state
	  structure members dh_arraysize, heard, and deleted has been added
	  to prevent simultaneous modification and access when IMAP storage
	  is in use. If IMAP storage is not in use, this locking is not
	  compiled in. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1994/

	  Add a cleaned up drop-in replacement for res_jabber called
	  res_xmpp. This provides the same externally facing functionality
	  but is implemented differently internally. This is currently not
	  built by default but this will be changed once chan_jingle2
	  (insert actual name in your head when reading this after it has
	  been merged) is in the tree. Review:
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1983/

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Ensure the timer heap is protected by a
	  lock.

	* res/pjproject/pjlib/include/pj/config_site.h: Enable IPv6 support
	  in pjproject.

	* res/res_rtp_asterisk.c: Don't try to send connectivity checks on
	  RTCP if RTCP is no longer present and don't do multiple ICE
	  connectivity checks at once.

	  The idea is to attach a Gosub routine to a channel that will
	  execute when the call hangs up. Whereas which h extension gets
	  executed depends on the location of dialplan execution when the
	  call hangs up, hangup handlers are attached to the call channel.
	  You can attach multiple handlers that will execute in the order
	  of most recently added first. (closes issue ASTERISK-19549)

	* main/cdr.c, /: Fix incorrect duration reporting in CDRs created
	  in batch mode Certain places in core/cdr.c would, if the duration
	  value were 0, calculate the duration as being the delta between
	  the current time and the time at which the CDR record was
	  started. While this does not typically cause a problem in
	  non-batch mode, this can cause an issue in batch mode where CDR
	  records are gathered and written long after those calls have
	  ended. In particular, this affects calls that were never
	  answered, as those are expected to have a duration of 0. Often,
	  this would result in CDR logs with a significant number of calls
	  with lengthy durations, but dispositions of "BUSY". Note that
	  this does not affect cdr_csv, as that backend does not use
	  ast_cdr_getvar and instead directly reports the duration value.
	  The affected core backends include cdr_apative_odbc and
	  cdr_custom; other extended or deprecated CDR backends may
	  potentially still directly manipulate the duration values. (issue

	  This patch adds the core changes necessary to support AMI event
	  documentation in the source files of Asterisk, and adds
	  documentation to those AMI events defined in the core application
	  modules. Event documentation is built from the source by two new
	  python scripts, located in build_tools: get_documentation.py and
	  post_process_documentation.py. The get_documentation.py script
	  mirrors the actions of the existing AWK get_documentation
	  scripts, except that it will scan the entirety of a source file
	  for Asterisk documentation. Upon encountering it, if the
	  documentation happens to be an AMI event, it will attempt to
	  extract information about the event directly from the manager
	  event macro calls that raise the event. The
	  post_process_documentation.py script combines manager event
	  instances that are the same event but documented in multiple
	  source files. It generates the final core-[lang].xml file. As
	  this process can take longer to complete than a typical 'make
	  all', it is only performed if a new make target, 'full', is
	  chosen. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1967/

	  in its entirety, yet still generating a valid response. This also
	  covers cases where Asterisk can not comprehend the offer if it is
	  in the correct format. Previously, chan_sip would reject SDP
	  offers or entirely ignore individual stream offers in an effort
	  to be more compatible which would often result in invalid SDP

	  routines be able to run on a hung up channel. This is preparation
	  work for hangup handler routines. * Fixed ability to support
	  relative non-normal dialplan execution routines. (i.e., The
	  context and exten are optional for the specified dialplan
	  location.) Predial routines are the only non-normal routines that
	  it makes sense to optionally omit the context and exten. Setting
	  a hangup handler also needs this ability. * Fix Return
	  application being able to restore a dialplan location exactly.
	  Channels without a PBX may not have context or exten set. * Fixes
	  non-normal execution routines like connected line interception
	  and predial leaving the dialplan execution stack unbalanced.
	  Errors like missing Return statements, popping too many stack
	  frames using StackPop, or an application returning non-zero could
	  leave the dialplan stack unbalanced. * Fixed the AGI gosub
	  application so it cleans up the dialplan execution stack and

	  The Hangup application used to just return -1 to cause normal
	  dialplan execution to hangup a channel. For the non-normal
	  execution routines like predial and connected-line interception
	  routines, the hangup request would exit the routine early but
	  otherwise be ignored. * Made the Hangup application not allow
	  setting a cause code of zero. A zero cause code is not defined.

	* /, channels/chan_skinny.c: AST-2012-009: Fix crash in chan_skinny
	  due to Key Pad Button Message handling AST-2012-008 (r367844)
	  fixed a denial of service attack exploitable in the Skinny
	  channel driver that occurred when certain messages are sent after
	  a previously registered station sends an Off Hook message.
	  Unresolved in that patch is an issue in the Asterisk 10 releases,
	  wherein, if a Station Key Pad Button Message is processed after
	  an Off Hook message, the channel driver will inappropriately
	  dereference a NULL pointer. This patch fixes those places where
	  the message handling or the channel callback functions would
	  attempt to dereference the line's pointer to the device. (issue

	* res/res_smdi.c, /, res/res_adsi.c: Mark res_smdi/res_adsi as

	  and chan_dahdi, as they both rely upon res_smdi and res_adsi,

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix deadlock in SIP transfers that involve a
	  REFER request In r367163, "send to voicemail" functionality was
	  added to the SIP channel driver. This required updating the party
	  redirecting information for the channel based on the headers
	  provided in the REFER request. When the redirecting party
	  information is updated on the channel, a call to
	  ast_indicate_data occurs. Because handle_request_refer still had
	  the sip_pvt locked, a deadlock could occur between the pbx_thread
	  and the do_monitor thread servicing the REFER request. This patch
	  preserves the proper locking order between the channel and the
	  sip_pvt by ensuring that the sip_pvt is unlocked prior to
	  updating the party redirecting information on the channel.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a specific scenario where ACKs are
	  not matched. If a dialog-starting INVITE contains a to-tag, then
	  Asterisk will respond with a 481. In this case, the resulting
	  incoming ACK would not be matched, so Asterisk would continue
	  retransmitting the 481 until the transaction times out. There
	  were two issues. Asterisk, upon creating a sip_pvt would generate
	  a local tag. However, when the time came to transmit the 481,
	  since there was a to-tag in the INVITE, Asterisk would place this
	  original to-tag in the 481 response. When the ACK came in,
	  Asterisk would attempt to match the to-tag in the ACK to the
	  generated local tag. Unfortunately, Asterisk never actually
	  transmitted a response with the generated local tag, so the
	  to-tag in the ACK would not match. The other problem was that
	  when the 481 was sent, nothing was set on the sip_pvt to indicate
	  what CSeq is expected in the ACK. To fix the first problem, we
	  zero out the to-tag seen in the incoming INVITE. This way,
	  Asterisk, when time to send a response, will send its generated
	  local tag instead. To fix the second problem, we set the
	  sip_pvt's pendinginvite to the CSeq of the INVITE when we send a
	  481. (closes issue ASTERISK-19892) Reported by Mark Michelson

	  main/asterisk.c, apps/app_voicemail.c: Merge changes dealing with
	  support for Digium phones. Presence support has been added. This
	  is accomplished by allowing for presence hints in addition to
	  device state hints. A dialplan function called PRESENCE_STATE has
	  been added to allow for setting and reading presence. Presence
	  can be transmitted to Digium phones using custom XML elements in
	  a PIDF presence document. Voicemail has new APIs that allow for
	  moving, removing, forwarding, and playing messages. Messages have
	  had a new unique message ID added to them so that the APIs will
	  work reliably. The state of a voicemail mailbox can be obtained
	  using an API that allows one to get a snapshot of the mailbox. A
	  voicemail Dialplan App called VoiceMailPlayMsg has been added to
	  be able to play back a specific message. Configuration hooks have
	  been added. Configuration hooks allow for a piece of code to be
	  executed when a specific configuration file is loaded by a
	  specific module. This is useful for modules that are dependent on
	  the configuration of other modules. chan_sip now has a public
	  method that allows for a custom SIP INFO request to be sent
	  mid-dialog. Digium phones use this in order to display progress
	  bars when files are played. Messaging support has been expanded a
	  bit. The main visible difference is the addition of an AMI action
	  MessageSend. Finally, a ParkingLots manager action has been added
	  in order to get a list of parking lots.

	* main/channel.c, /: Fix potential deadlock between masquerade and
	  chan_local. * Restructure ast_do_masquerade() to not hold channel
	  locks while it calls ast_indicate(). * Simplify many calls to
	  ast_do_masquerade() since it will never return a failure now. If
	  it does fail internally because a channel driver callback
	  operation failed, the only thing ast_do_masquerade() can do is
	  generate a warning message about strange things may happen and
	  press on. * Fixed the call to ast_bridged_channel() in
	  ast_do_masquerade(). This change fixes half of the deadlock
	  reported in ASTERISK-19801 between masquerades and chan_iax.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Improve SDP offer/answer RFC compliance
	  Asterisk should not accept SDP offers that contain unknown RTP
	  profiles (for audio/video streams) or unknown top-level media
	  types. When it does, it answers with an SDP that does not match
	  the offer properly, and this will nearly always result in a
	  broken call. This patch causes such offers to be rejected.
	  Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1811/

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Improve SDP parsing warning messages *
	  'Unsupported media type' is only reported when that is in fact

	  line that has an invalid format. * All warning messages related
	  to parsing 'm' lines now include the 'm' line contents. * (minor
	  bugfix) newline added to port-number-zero warning messages. *
	  Warning messages improved to use RFC-specified terminology for
	  various items. * Warnings for offers that include more than one
	  port for a single media type now include the media type. Review:

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample,
	  channels/sip/include/sip.h: Help mitigate potential reinvite
	  glare scenarios. When Asterisk servers are set up back-to-back,
	  and direct media is to be used betweeen endpoints, it is fairly
	  common for the two Asterisk servers to send direct media
	  reinvites to each other simultaneously. This results in 491s and
	  ACKs being exchanged between the servers. While the media
	  eventually gets set up properly, the problem is that there can be
	  a noticeable delay for the streams to stabilize. This patch adds
	  a new directmedia option called "outgoing". With this set, an
	  immediate direct media reinvite will only be sent if the call
	  direction is outgoing. For incoming dialogs, an immediate direct
	  media reinvite will not be sent, but further "reactionary" direct
	  media reinvites may be sent. Review:

	  can later be dereferened if a message or channel event attempts

	* apps/app_dial.c, /, apps/app_queue.c: Fix Dial I option ignored
	  if dial forked and one fork redirects. The Dial and Queue I
	  option is intended to block connected line updates and
	  redirecting updates. However, it is a feature that when a call is
	  locally redirected, the I option is disabled if the redirected
	  call runs as a local channel so the administrator can have an
	  opportunity to setup new connected line information.
	  Unfortunately, the Dial and Queue I option is disabled for *all*
	  forked calls if one of those calls is redirected. * Make the Dial
	  and Queue I option apply to each outgoing call leg independently.
	  Now if one outgoing call leg is locally redirected, the other
	  outgoing calls are not affected. * Made Dial not pass any
	  redirecting updates when forking calls. Redirecting updates do
	  not make sense for this scenario. * Made Queue not pass any
	  redirecting updates when using the ringall strategy. Redirecting
	  updates do not make sense for this scenario. * Fixed deadlock

	* /, apps/app_confbridge.c: Fix crash in ConfBridge when user
	  announcement is played for more than 2 users A patch introduced
	  in r354938 made it so that ConfBridge would not attempt to play
	  sound files if those files did not exist. Unfortunately,
	  ConfBridge uses the same underlying function, play_sound_helper,
	  to playback both sound files and numbers to callers. When a
	  number is being played back, the name of the sound file is
	  expected to be NULL. This NULL value was passed into a function
	  that tested for the existance of a sound file and is not tolerant
	  to NULL file names, causing a crash. This patch fixes the
	  behavior, such that if a sound file does not exist we do not
	  attempt to play it, but we only attempt that check if the a sound
	  file was specified in the first place. If a sound file was not
	  specified, we use the 'play number' logic in the helper function.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, channels/sip/include/sip.h: Re-add
	  LastMsgsSent value for SIP peers Previously, MWI logic utilized a
	  counter called 'lastmsgssent' to know whether or not MWI NOTIFY
	  requests had been sent to a specific peer. When MWI notifications
	  were changed to use the internal event framework, this value was
	  no longer needed for its original purpose. Hence, it was no
	  longer updated with the new/old message counts for a peer. The
	  value was previously removed for Asterisk 10; however, since it
	  was still present in Asterisk 1.8 and still useful for reporting
	  purposes, it was decided to re-add the value. This patch re-adds
	  the 'LastMsgsSent' field in the response to an AMI/CLI 'sip show
	  peer [peer]' command, and makes it so that the value of
	  lastmsgssent is updated appropriately. The value should now
	  display the new/old message counts for a particular peer. (closes

	  cause the CEL LINKEDID_END event to be missed. 1) During a core
	  stop gracefully, modules are unloaded when ast_active_channels ==
	  0. The LINKDEDID_END event fires during the channel destructor.
	  This means that occasionally, the cel_* module will be unloaded
	  before the channel is destroyed. It seemed generally useful to
	  wait until the refcount of all channels == 0 before unloading, so
	  I added a channel counter and used it in the shutdown code. 2)
	  During a masquerade, ast_channel_change_linkedid is called. It
	  calls ast_cel_check_retire_linkedid which unrefs the linkedid in
	  the linkedids container in cel.c. It didn't ref the new linkedid.
	  Now it does. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1900/

	  phones indicate the desire to direct a call to voicemail by using
	  a Diversion header with a reason parameter of "send_to_vm". This
	  patch adds the "send_to_vm" reason as a valid redirecting reason.

	  typically set up a single SSL_CTX for their lifetime. This is
	  solved in two ways: 1. In __ssl_setup(), if a tcptls_cfg has an
	  ssl_ctx on it, it is freed so that a new one can take its place.
	  2. A companion to ast_ssl_setup() called ast_ssl_teardown() has

	* channels/chan_local.c: The predial routine must be run on the

	  party id information. Other reasons it was a bad idea to run
	  predial on the local;2 channel: 1) The channel has not been
	  completely setup. The ast_call() completes the setup. 2) The
	  local;2 caller and connected line party information is opposite
	  to any other channels predial runs on. (And it hasn't been setup

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Prevent sip_pvt refleak when an
	  ast_channel outlasts its corresponding sip_pvt. chan_sip was
	  coded under the assumption that a SIP dialog with an owner
	  channel will always be destroyed after the owner channel has been
	  hung up. However, there are situations where the SIP dialog can
	  time out and auto destruct before the corresponding channel has
	  hung up. A typical example of this would be if the 'h' extension
	  in the dialplan takes a long time to complete. In such cases,
	  __sip_autodestruct() would complain about the dialog being auto
	  destroyed with an owner channel still in place. The problem is
	  that even once the owner channel was hung up, the sip_pvt would
	  still be linked in its ao2_container because nothing would ever
	  unlink it. The fix for this is that if __sip_autodestruct() is
	  called for a sip_pvt that still has an owner channel in place,
	  the destruction is rescheduled for 10 seconds in the future. This
	  will continue until the owner channel is finally hung up. (closes

	  digit did not happen to exist in some extension, a dialplan match
	  would fail and the user would not be redirected. This patch fixes

	* channels/chan_local.c, /: Fix local channel chains optimizing
	  themselves out of a call. * Made chan_local.c:check_bridge()
	  check the return value of ast_channel_masquerade(). In long
	  chains of local channels, the masquerade occasionally fails to
	  get setup because there is another masquerade already setup on an
	  adjacent local channel in the chain. * Made the outgoing local
	  channel (the ;2 channel) flush one voice or video frame per
	  optimization attempt. * Made sure that the outgoing local channel
	  also does not have any frames in its queue before the masquerade.
	  * Made do the masquerade immediately to minimize the chance that
	  the outgoing channel queue does not get any new frames added and
	  thus unconditionally flushed. * Made block indication -1 (Stop
	  tones) event when the local channel is going to optimize itself
	  out. When the call is answered, a chain of local channels pass
	  down a -1 indication for each bridge. This blizzard of -1 events

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Revert revision 360862. Revision 360862
	  was intended to improve identities sent in dialog-info NOTIFY

	  was done. It's not clear exactly what part of the patch has
	  caused this regression, but broken hints are bad. For now, this
	  revision is being reverted so that the next releases of Asterisk
	  do not have bad behavior in them. The original reported issue
	  will have to be fixed differently in the next version of
	  Asterisk. (issue ASTERISK-16735) ........ Merged revisions 364706

	* /, include/asterisk/time.h: Prevent overflow in calculation in
	  ast_tvdiff_ms on 32-bit machines The method ast_tvdiff_ms
	  attempts to calculate the difference, in milliseconds, between
	  two timeval structs, and return the difference in a 64-bit
	  integer. Unfortunately, it assumes that the long tv_sec/tv_usec
	  members in the timeval struct are large enough to hold the
	  calculated values before it returns. On 64-bit machines, this
	  might be the case, as a long may be 64-bits. On 32-bit machines,
	  however, a long may be less (32-bits), in which case, the
	  calculation can overflow. This overflow caused significant
	  problems in MixMonitor, which uses the method to determine if an
	  audio factory, which has not presented audio to an audiohook, is
	  merely late in providing said audio or will never provide audio.
	  In an overflow situation, the audiohook would incorrectly
	  determine that an audio factory that will never provide audio is
	  merely late instead. This led to situations where a MixMonitor
	  never recorded any audio. Note that this happened most frequently
	  when that MixMonitor was started by the ConfBridge application
	  itself, or when the MixMonitor was attached to a Local channel.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Allow for reloading SRTP crypto keys
	  within the same SIP dialog As a continuation of the patch in
	  r356604, which allowed for the reloading of SRTP keys in
	  re-INVITE transfer scenarios, this patch addresses the more
	  common case where a new key is requested within the context of a
	  current SIP dialog. This can occur, for example, when certain
	  phones request a SIP hold. Previously, once a dialog was
	  associated with an SRTP object, any subsequent attempt to process
	  crypto keys in any SDP offer - either the current one or a new
	  offer in a new SIP request - were ignored. This patch changes
	  this behavior to only ignore subsequent crypto keys within the
	  current SDP offer, but allows future SDP offers to change the
	  keys. (issue ASTERISK-19253) Reported by: Thomas Arimont Tested

	  addons/chan_mobile.c, main/format_pref.c, main/asterisk.c: Fix a
	  variety of potential buffer overflows * chan_mobile: Fixed an
	  overrun where the cind_state buffer (an integer array of size 16)
	  would be overrun due to improper bounds checking. At worst, the
	  buffer can be overrun by a total of 48 bytes (assuming 4-byte
	  integers), which would still leave it within the allocated memory
	  of struct hfp. This would corrupt other elements in that struct
	  but not necessarily cause any further issues. * app_sms: The
	  array imsg is of size 250, while the array (ud) that the data is
	  copied into is of size 160. If the size of the inbound message is
	  greater then 160, up to 90 bytes could be overrun in ud. This
	  would corrupt the user data header (array udh) adjacent to ud. *
	  chan_unistim: A number of invalid memmoves are corrected. These
	  would move data (which may or may not be valid) into the ends of
	  these buffers. * asterisk: ast_console_toggle_loglevel does not
	  check that the console log level being set is less then or equal
	  to the allowed log levels of 32. * format_pref: In
	  ast_codec_pref_prepend, if any occurrence of the specified codec
	  is not found, the value used to index into the array pref->order
	  would be one greater then the maximum size of the array. *
	  jitterbuf: If the element being placed into the jitter buffer
	  lands in the last available slot in the jitter history buffer,
	  the insertion sort attempts to move the last entry in the buffer
	  into one slot past the maximum length of the buffer. Note that
	  this occurred for both the min and max jitter history buffers. *
	  tdd: If a read from fsk_serial returns a character that is
	  greater then 32, an attempt to read past one of the statically
	  defined arrays containing the values that character maps to would
	  occur. * localtime: struct ast_time and tm are not the same size
	  - ast_time is larger, although it contains the elements of tm
	  within it in the same layout. Hence, when using memcpy to copy
	  the contents of tm into ast_time, the size of tm should be used,
	  as opposed to the size of ast_time. * extconf: this treats
	  ast_timing's minmask array as if it had a length of 48, when it
	  has defined the size of the array as 24. pbx.h defines minmask as
	  having a size of 48. (issue ASTERISK-19668) Reported by: Matt

	  operations to set max file size to '1' or '0' A very
	  inappropriate placement of a ')' (introduced in r362151) caused
	  the maximum size of a file to be set as the result of a
	  comparison operation, as opposed to the result of the ftello
	  operation. This resulted in seeking being restricted to the
	  beginning of the file, or 1 byte into the file. Thanks to the
	  Asterisk Test Suite for properly freaking out about this on at
	  least one test. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt Jordan

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Turn off warning message when bind
	  address is set to any. When a bind address is set to an ANY
	  address (udpbindport=::), a warning message is displayed stating
	  that "Address remapping activated in sip.conf but we're using
	  IPv6, which doesn't need it. Please remove 'localnet' and/or
	  'externaddr' settings." But if one is running dual stack, we
	  shouldn't be told to turn those settings off. This patch checks
	  if the bind address is an ANY address or not. The warning message
	  will now only be displayed if the bind address is NOT an ANY
	  address and IPv6 is being used. Also, updated the copyright year.

	* channels/chan_dahdi.c, /, channels/chan_agent.c: Fix negative
	  return handling in channel drivers In chan_agent, while handling
	  a channel indicate, the agent channel driver must obtain a lock
	  on both the agent channel, as well as the channel the agent
	  channel is using. To do so, it attempts to lock the other channel
	  first, then unlock the agent channel which is locked prior to
	  entry into the indicate handler. If this unlock fails with a
	  negative return value, which can occur if the object passed to
	  agent_indicate is an invalid ao2 object or is NULL, the return
	  value is passed directly to strerror, which can only accept
	  positive integer values. In chan_dahdi, the return value of
	  dahdi_get_index is used to directly index into the sub-channel
	  array. If dahd_get_index returns a negative value, it would use
	  that value to index into the array, which could cause an invalid
	  memory access. If dahdi_get_index returns a negative number, we
	  now default to SUB_REAL. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt

	* /, apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix handling of negative return code
	  when storing voicemails in ODBC storage When storing a voicemail
	  message using an ODBC connection to a database, the voicemail
	  message is first stored on disk. The sound file associated with
	  the message is read into memory before being transmitted to the
	  database. When this occurs, a failure in the C library's lseek
	  function would cause a negative value to be passed to the mmap as
	  the size of the memory map to create. This would almost certainly
	  cause the creation of the memory map to fail, resulting in the
	  message being lost. (issue ASTERISK-19655) Reported by: Matt

	  include/asterisk/security_events_defs.h: Add IPv6 address support
	  to security events framework. The current Security Events

	  Security Events Framework API to support IPV6 and updates the
	  components that use this API. * Eliminates an error message that
	  was being generated since the current implementation was treating
	  an IPv6 socket address as if it was IPv4. * Some copyright dates

	  stream were not being checked. In some situations, if an error
	  occurred, a negative value would be returned from the library

	* /, funcs/func_global.c: Change SHARED function to use a safe

	  modifies a variable, it removes it from its list of variables and
	  reinserts the new value at the head of the list of variables.
	  Doing this inside a standard list traversal can be dangerous, as
	  the standard list traversal does not account for the list being
	  changed. While the code in question should not cause a use after
	  free violation due to its breaking out of the loop after freeing
	  the variable, it could lead to a maintenance issue if the loop
	  was modified. This also fixes a violation reported by a static
	  analysis tool, which also makes this code easier to maintain in

	* /, main/features.c: Fix potential race condition during call
	  pickup. Prior to this patch, a connected line update was queued
	  during call pickup and then an answer frame was queued. The
	  original caller would presumably then have his connected line
	  updated and then the call would be answered. In actuality, the
	  answer frame was not how the call ended up being answered.
	  Rather, an odd section in app_dial that checks if the called
	  channel's state is up. The result is that the order of the
	  connected line update and the answer were variable. In most
	  cases, this wasn't actually a bad thing. However, if the 'I'
	  option was passed to dial, the connected line update would be
	  inhibited. The fix is to queued the connected line after the
	  answer frame is queued. This way the race in app_dial is between
	  two conditions resulting in an answer. This way the connected
	  line update occurs after the answer every time. (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure Asterisk sends a BYE when pending
	  on the final response to a re-INVITE When Asterisk detects a
	  hangup and cannot send a BYE due to a pending INVITE, it sets the
	  pendingbye flag and waits for the final response to that INVITE.
	  When the response is received, it transmits the BYE. If, however,
	  that INVITE request is a pending re-INVITE, it needs to first
	  send a CANCEL request to terminate the pending re-INVITE. In that
	  circumstance, Asterisk was, in some scenarios, clearing the
	  pendingbye flag after processing the CANCEL request and not
	  checking for a pending BYE when receiving the final 487 response
	  to the INVITE. This patch ensures that if the pendingbye flag is
	  set, it is honored regardless of the nature of the INVITE request
	  currently in flight. (closes issue ASTERISK-19365) Reported by:

	  include/asterisk/manager.h, main/db.c: Allow AMI action callback
	  to be reentrant. Fix AMI module reload deadlock regression from
	  ASTERISK-18479 when it tried to fix the race between calling an
	  AMI action callback and unregistering that action. Refixes
	  ASTERISK-13784 broken by ASTERISK-17785 change. Locking the ao2
	  object guaranteed that there were no active callbacks that
	  mattered when ast_manager_unregister() was called. Unfortunately,
	  this causes the deadlock situation. The patch stops locking the
	  ao2 object to allow multiple threads to invoke the callback
	  re-entrantly. There is no way to guarantee a module unload will
	  not crash because of an active callback. The code attempts to
	  minimize the chance with the registered flag and the maximum 5
	  second delay before ast_manager_unregister() returns. The trunk
	  version of the patch changes the API to fix the race condition
	  correctly to prevent the module code from unloading from memory
	  while an action callback is active. * Don't hold the lock while
	  calling the AMI action callback. (closes issue ASTERISK-19487)

	* /, main/jitterbuf.c: Fix incorrect jitter buffer overflow due to
	  missed resynchronizations When a change in time occurs, such that
	  the timestamps associated with frames being placed into an
	  adaptive jitter buffer (implemented in jitterbuf.c) are
	  significantly different then the previously inserted frames, the
	  jitter buffer checks to see if it needs to be resynched to the
	  new time frame. If three consecutive packets break the threshold,
	  the jitter buffer resynchs itself to the new timestamps. This
	  currently only occurs when history is calculated, and hence only
	  on JB_TYPE_VOICE frames. JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames, on the other
	  hand, are never passed to the history calculations. Because of
	  this, if the jump in time is greater then the maximum allowed
	  length of the jitter buffer, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames are
	  dropped and no resynchronization occurs. Alterntively, if the
	  overfill logic is not triggered, the JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame will
	  be placed into the buffer, but with a time reference that is not
	  applicable. Subsequent JB_TYPE_VOICE frames will quickly trigger
	  the overflow logic until reads from the jitter buffer reach the
	  errant JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame. This patch allows JB_TYPE_CONTROL
	  frames to resynch the jitter buffer. As JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames
	  are unlikely to occur in multiples, it perform the
	  resynchronization on any JB_TYPE_CONTROL frame that breaks the
	  resynch threshold. Note that this only impacts chan_iax2, as
	  other consumers of the adaptive jitter buffer use the abstract
	  jitter buffer API, which does not use JB_TYPE_CONTROL frames.

	* include/asterisk/astobj2.h: Force non-inlining of
	  ao2_iterator_destroy when TEST_FRAMEWORK is enabled In r357272,
	  astobj2 was changed to automatically enable REF_DEBUG when the
	  TEST_FRAMEWORK flag was enabled. Unfortunately, some compilers
	  (gcc 4.5.1 at least) will attempt to inline ao2_iterator_destroy
	  in handle_astobj2_test. This by itself is not a problem;
	  unfortunately, the compiler believes that there is a code path
	  wherein an object allocated on the stack will be free'd. As
	  warnings are treated as errors, this prevents compilation of
	  astobj2. This patch works around that by adding the noinline
	  attribue to ao2_iterator_destroy, but only if the TEST_FRAMEWORK
	  flag is enabled. Preventing inlining is only needed for the test
	  method defined in astobj2, which is also only enabled if
	  TEST_FRAMEWORK is enabled.

	  invalid SIP devices return Unavail, not idle This patch
	  drastically simplifies the device state aggegation code. The old
	  method was not only overly complex, but also made it impossible
	  to return AST_DEVICE_INVALID from the aggregation code. The unit
	  test update is as a result of fixing that bug. The SIP change
	  stems from a bug introduced by removing a DNS lookup for
	  hostname-based SIP channels. (closes issue ASTERISK-16702)

	* res/ael/pval.c, funcs/func_dialplan.c, /, tests/test_gosub.c,
	  utils/ael_main.c, apps/app_stack.c, utils/conf2ael.c: Enable
	  macros in 1.8 to find the next highest "h" extension in a
	  context, like in 1.4. This change restores functionality that was
	  present in 1.4, when AEL macros were implemented with the Macro
	  dialplan application. Macros are fraught with functionality
	  issues, because they consume a large portion of the underlying
	  application stack. This limits the ability of AEL users to call
	  many layers of subroutines, an issue which Gosub does not have
	  (originally tested to 100,000 levels deep). Therefore, starting
	  in 1.6.0, AEL macros were implemented with Gosub. However, there
	  were some implicit behaviors of Macro, which were not replicated
	  at the same time as with the transition to Gosub, one of which is
	  documented in the related issue. In particular, the "h" extension
	  is designed to execute not in the Macro context, but in the
	  topmost calling context. Due to legacy issues with a misapplied
	  bugfix many years ago, when a macro exited in 1.4, it looks in
	  all calling contexts, bubbling up from the deepest level until it
	  finds an "h" extension. Since AEL hides the complexity of the
	  underlying dialplan logic from the AEL programmer, it's
	  reasonable to assume that this behavior should not change in the
	  transition from Asterisk 1.4 LTS to Asterisk 1.8 LTS, lest we
	  break working AEL configurations in the transition to Asterisk
	  1.8 LTS. This fix is the result, which implements a search for
	  the "h" extension in all calling Gosub contexts. Fixes

	* main/channel.c, /: Fix race condition that can cause important
	  control frames (such as a hangup) to be missed. This takes two
	  actions. 1. Move the reading of the alertpipe in __ast_read() to
	  immediately before the removal of frames from the readq. This
	  means we won't do something silly like read from the alertpipe,
	  then ignore the fact that there's a frame to get from the readq
	  since channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD. 2. When
	  ast_settimeout() sets the rate to 0 and the timingfunc to NULL,
	  if the channel's fdno is the AST_TIMING_FD, then set the fdno to
	  -1. This is because if the rate is 0 and the timingfunc is NULL,
	  it means that the channel's timing fd is being invalidated, so
	  any pending reads should not occur. This may actually solve more
	  issues than the referenced one below, but it's not known at this
	  time for sure. (closes issue ASTERISK-19223) reported by

	  include/asterisk/lock.h, main/astobj2.c: Astobj2 locking
	  enhancement. Add the ability to specify what kind of locking an
	  ao2 object has when it is allocated. The locking could be one of:
	  MUTEX, RWLOCK, or none. New API: ao2_t_alloc_options()
	  ao2_alloc_options() ao2_t_container_alloc_options()
	  ao2_container_alloc_options() ao2_rdlock() ao2_wrlock()
	  ao2_tryrdlock() ao2_trywrlock() The OBJ_NOLOCK and
	  AO2_ITERATOR_DONTLOCK flags have a slight meaning change. They no
	  longer mean that the object is protected by an external
	  mechanism. They mean the lock associated with the object has
	  already been manually obtained by one of the ao2_lock calls. This
	  change is necessary for RWLOCK support since they are not
	  reentrant. Also an operation on an ao2 container may require
	  promoting a read lock to a write lock by releasing the already
	  held read lock to re-acquire as a write lock. Replaced API calls:
	  ao2_t_link_nolock() ao2_link_nolock() ao2_t_unlink_nolock()
	  ao2_unlink_nolock() with the respective ao2_t_link_flags()
	  ao2_link_flags() ao2_t_unlink_flags() ao2_unlink_flags() API
	  calls to be more flexible and to allow an anticipated enhancement
	  to control linking duplicate objects into a container. The
	  changes to format.c and format_cap.c are taking advantange of the
	  new ao2 locking options to simplify the use of the format
	  capabilities containers. Review:

	* include/asterisk/astobj2.h, tests/test_astobj2.c, main/astobj2.c:
	  Add ability to clone ao2 containers. Occasionally there is a need
	  to put all objects in one container also into another container.
	  Some reasons you might need to do this: 1) You need to
	  reconfigure a container. You would do this by creating a new
	  container with the new configuration and ao2_container_dup the
	  old container into it. Then replace the old container with the
	  new. Then destroy the old container. 2) You need the contents of
	  a container to remain stable while operating on all of the
	  objects. You would do this by creating a cloned container of the
	  original with ao2_container_clone. The cloned container is a
	  snapshot of the objects at the time of the cloning. When done,
	  just destroy the cloned container. Review:

	* /, apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix crash in app_voicemail during
	  close_mailbox In r354890, a memory leak in app_voicemail was
	  fixed by properly disposing of the allocated heard/deleted
	  pointers. However, there are situations, particularly when no
	  messages are found in a folder, where these pointers are not
	  allocated and not NULL. In that case, an invalid free would be
	  attempted, which could crash app_voicemail. As there are a number
	  of code paths where this could occur, this patch uses the number
	  of messages detected in the folder before it attempts to free the
	  pointers. This resolves the crash detected in the Asterisk Test
	  Suite's check_voicemail_nominal test. ........ Merged revisions

	* /, res/res_srtp.c: Remove srtp_shutdown from res_srtp The patch
	  for ASTERISK-19253 included properly shutting down the libsrtp
	  library in the case of module unload. Unfortunately, not all
	  distributions have the srtp_shutdown call. As such, this patch
	  removes calling srtp_shutdown. ........ Merged revisions 356650

	  res/res_srtp.c: Allow SRTP policies to be reloaded Currently,
	  when using res_srtp, once the SRTP policy has been added to the
	  current session the policy is locked into place. Any attempt to
	  replace an existing policy, which would be needed if the remote
	  endpoint negotiated a new cryptographic key, is instead rejected
	  in res_srtp. This happens in particular in transfer scenarios,
	  where the endpoint that Asterisk is communicating with changes
	  but uses the same RTP session. This patch modifies res_srtp to
	  allow remote and local policies to be reloaded in the underlying
	  SRTP library. From the perspective of users of the SRTP API, the
	  only change is that the adding of remote and local policies are
	  now added in a single method call, whereas they previously were
	  added separately. This was changed to account for the differences
	  in handling remote and local policies in libsrtp. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, main/features.c: Fix blind transfer
	  parking issues if the dialed extension is not recognized as a
	  parking extension. Custom parking extensions may not be coded
	  such that the first and only extension priority is the Park
	  application. These custom parking extensions will not be
	  recognized as parking extensions. When a call is blind
	  transferred to an extension that is not recognized as a parking
	  extension, the normal blind transfer code causes the transferred
	  channel to start executing dialplan. Calls that get parked in
	  this manner do not know the original channel name that parked the
	  call so the original parker could never be called back if the
	  parked call is not retrieved before the timeout time. The parking
	  space is also announced to the call being parked as a side effect
	  of not knowing the original parking channel. * Fix handling of
	  BLINDTRANSFER channel variable for call parking. * Fixed SIP
	  blind transfer using the wrong dialplan context variable to check
	  for the parking extension. (closes issue ASTERISK-19322) Reported

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix ACK routing for non-2xx responses.
	  When we send an ACK for a 2xx response to an INVITE, we are
	  supposed to use the learned route set. However, when we receive a
	  non-2xx final response to an INVITE, we are supposed to send the
	  ACK to the same place we initially sent the INVITE. We had been
	  doing this up until the changes went in that would build a route
	  set from provisional responses. That introduced a regression
	  where we would use the learned route set under all circumstances.
	  With this change, we now will set the destination of our ACK
	  based on the invitestate. If it is INV_COMPLETED then that means
	  that we have received a non-2xx final response (INV_TERMINATED
	  indicates a 2xx response was received). If it is INV_CANCELLED,
	  then that means the call is being canceled, which means that we
	  should be ACKing a 487 response. The other change introduced here
	  is setting the invitestate to INV_CONFIRMED when we send an ACK
	  *after* the reqprep instead of before. This way, we can tell in
	  reqprep more easily what the invitestate is prior to sending the
	  ACK. (closes issue ASTERISK-19389) reported by Karsten Wemheuer

	  | 27 lines Fix potential buffer overrun and memory leak when
	  executing "sip show peers" The "sip show peers" command uses a
	  fix sized array to sort the current peers in the peers
	  ao2_container. The size of the array is based on the current
	  number of peers in the container. However, once the size of the
	  array is determined, the number of peers in the container can
	  change, as the peers container is not locked. This could cause a
	  buffer overrun when populating the array, if peers were added to
	  the container after the array was created. Additionally, a memory
	  leak of the allocated array would occur if a user caused the
	  _show_peers method to return CLI_SHOWUSAGE. We now create a
	  snapshot of the current peers using an ao2_callback with the
	  OBJ_MULTIPLE flag. This size of the array is set to the number of
	  peers that the iterator will iterate over; hence, if peers are
	  added or removed from the peers container it will not affect the
	  execution of the "sip show peers" command. Review:

	* /, channels/chan_iax2.c: Pass the correct value to
	  ast_timer_set_rate() for IAX2 trunking. IAX2 uses the trunkfreq
	  variable to determine how often to send trunk packets, but this
	  value is in milliseconds while ast_timer_set_rate() expects the
	  rate argument to be ticks per second. So we divide 1000 by
	  trunkfreq and pass that in instead. With a default of 20ms, this
	  change makes IAX2 send trunk packets every 20ms instead of every
	  50ms. Tracked down by myself and Bob Wienholt. ........ Merged

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix regressions with regards to route-set
	  creation on early dialogs. This fixes two main issues: 1.
	  Asterisk would send a CANCEL to the route created by the
	  provisional response instead of using the same destination it did
	  in the initial INVITE. 2. If a new route set arrives in a 200 OK
	  than was in the 1XX response (perfectly possible if our outbound
	  INVITE gets forked), then the route set in the 200 OK needs to
	  overwrite the route set in the 1XX response. (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Fix SIP INFO DTMF handling for
	  non-numeric codes In ASTERISK-18924, SIP INFO DTMF handlingw as
	  changed to account for both lowercase alphatbetic DTMF events, as
	  well as uppercase alphabetic DTMF events. When this occurred, the
	  comparison of the character buffer containing the event code was
	  changed such that the buffer was first compared again '0' and '9'
	  to determine if it was numeric. Unfortunately, since the first
	  character in the buffer will typically be '1' in the case of
	  non-numeric event codes (10-16), this caused those codes to be
	  converted to a DTMF event of '1'. This patch fixes that, and
	  cleans up handling of both application/dtmf-relay and
	  application/dtmf content types. Review:

	* main/channel.c, /: Remove some unnecessary locking from
	  ast_hangup(). This patch removes some unnecessary locking of the
	  channels container in ast_hangup(). The reason this came up is
	  that this lock can very quickly block the entire system. If any
	  of the channel cleanup code decides to block, it causes a problem
	  for the whole system. For example, when audiohooks get destroyed,
	  if that blocks for a while waiting on the mixmonitor thread to
	  exit because it's busy blocking on some I/O, it causes a problem
	  for many other threads in the meantime. Review:

	* res/res_ais.c (removed), contrib/scripts/install_prereq: Revision
	  354046 added res_corosync as a replacement for res_ais, but
	  didn't actually remove res_ais. This commit removes it. In
	  addition, the 'install_prereq' script has been updated to no
	  longer install AIS dependency packages, and instead install
	  Corosync packages instead.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, contrib/realtime/postgresql/realtime.sql,
	  CHANGES, channels/sip/include/sip.h: Add callbackextension
	  matching & realtime callbackextensions This patch is based on the
	  one by David Vossel, developer extrodinaire, at
	  https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/344/. If multiple peers are
	  defined with the same host/port, but differing
	  callbackextensions, it chooses the peer with the matching
	  callbackextension. Since callbackextension creates an outbound
	  registration with the callbackextension as the Contact address,
	  matching an incoming request by that (in addition to the
	  host/port) makes a lot of sense. This patch also adds support for
	  callbackextension to realtime by querying all peers with
	  callbackextensions on reload and adding registrations for them.

	  unloaded. res_calendar can potentially create many threads and
	  I've seen issues where the Asterisk shutdown has failed where it
	  looked like these threads could be the culprit. This patch adds
	  unload support for res_calendar. Unloading res_calendar will also
	  unload the dependant tech modules as well. (closes issue

	* main/dnsmgr.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h:
	  Re-link peers by IP when dnsmgr changes the IP Asterisk's dnsmgr
	  currently takes a pointer to an ast_sockaddr and updates it
	  anytime an address resolves to something different. There are a
	  couple of issues with this. First, the ast_sockaddr is usually
	  the address of an ast_sockaddr inside a refcounted struct and we
	  never bump the refcount of those structs when using dnsmgr. This
	  makes it possible that a refresh could happen after the
	  destructor for that object is called (despite ast_dnsmgr_release
	  being called in that destructor). Second, the module using dnsmgr
	  cannot be aware of an address changing without polling for it in
	  the code. If an action needs to be taken on address update (like
	  re-linking a SIP peer in the peers_by_ip table), then polling for
	  this change negates many of the benefits of having dnsmgr in the
	  first place. This patch adds a function to the dnsmgr API that
	  calls an update callback instead of blindly updating the address
	  itself. It also moves calls to ast_dnsmgr_release outside of the
	  destructor functions and into cleanup functions that are called
	  when we no longer need the objects and increments the refcount of
	  the objects using dnsmgr since those objects are stored on the
	  ast_dnsmgr_entry struct. A helper function for returning the
	  proper default SIP port (non-tls vs tls) is also added and used.
	  This patch also incorporates changes from a patch posted by Timo
	  Teräs to ASTERISK-19106 for related dnsmgr issues. (closes issue

	* Makefile: Correct serious flaw in the top-level Makefile.

	  (added): Address OpenSSL initialization issues when using
	  third-party libraries. When Asterisk is used with various
	  third-party libraries (CURL, PostgresSQL, many others) that have
	  the ability themselves to use OpenSSL, it is possible for
	  conflicts to arise in how the OpenSSL libraries are initialized
	  and shutdown. This patch addresses these conflicts by 'wrapping'
	  the important functions from the OpenSSL libraries in a new
	  shared library that is part of Asterisk itself, and is loaded in
	  such a way as to ensure that *all* calls to these functions will
	  be dispatched through the Asterisk wrapper functions, not the
	  native functions. This new library is optional, but enabled by
	  default. See the CHANGES file for documentation on how to disable
	  it. Along the way, this patch also makes a few other minor
	  changes: * Changes MODULES_DIR to ASTMODDIR throughout the build
	  system, in order to more closely match what is used during
	  run-time configuration. * Corrects some errors in the configure
	  script where AC_CHECK_TOOLS was used instead of AC_PATH_PROG. *
	  Adds a new variable for linker flags in the build system
	  (DYLINK), used for producing true shared libraries (as opposed to
	  the dynamically loadable modules that the build system produces
	  for 'regular' Asterisk modules). * Moves the Makefile bits that
	  handle installation and uninstallation of the main Asterisk
	  binary into main/Makefile from the top-level Makefile. * Moves a
	  couple of useful preprocessor macros from optional_api.h to
	  asterisk.h. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1006/

	  warning message. This was misleading, as the media type was not

	* Makefile, include/asterisk/version.h (added), main/test.c,
	  build_tools/make_version_h (removed), include/asterisk: Remove
	  "asterisk/version.h" in favor of "asterisk/ast_version.h". A long
	  time ago, in a land far far away, we added
	  "asterisk/ast_version.h", which provides the ast_get_version()
	  and ast_get_version_num() functions. These were added so that
	  modules that needed the version information for the Asterisk
	  instance they were loaded in could actually get it (as opposed
	  the version that they were compiled against). We changed
	  everything in the tree to use the new mechanism (although later
	  main/test.c was added using the old method). However, the old
	  mechanism was never removed, and as a result, new code is still
	  trying to use it. This commit removes asterisk/version.h and
	  replaces it with a header that will generate a compile-time error
	  if you try to use it (the error message tells you which header
	  you should use instead). It also removes the Makefile and
	  build_tools bits that generated the file, and it updates
	  main/test.c to use the 'proper' method of getting the Asterisk
	  version information. This is an API change and thus is being
	  committed for trunk only, but it's a fairly minor one and
	  definitely improves the situation for out-of-tree modules.

	  and AMI actions have been ammended to work with the IDs as well.
	  In addition, monitors across a channel can now be listed be
	  listed via CLI command "mixmonitor list <channel>" which will
	  display all of the mixmonitors active on that channel along with
	  the files they each have open. Created by Sergio González Martín.

	  header had a quoted string with an item in angle brackets, then
	  we would mis-parse it. For instance, "Bob <1234>"

	  | 22 lines Add some missing locking in chan_sip. This patch adds
	  some missing locking to the function
	  send_provisional_keepalive_full(). This function is called from
	  the scheduler, which is processed in the SIP monitor thread. The
	  associated channel (or pbx) thread will also be using the same
	  sip_pvt and ast_channel so locking must be used. The
	  sip_pvt_lock_full() function is used to ensure proper locking
	  order in a safe manner. In passing, document a suspected
	  reference counting error in this function. The "fix" is left
	  commented out because when the "fix" is present, crashes occur.
	  My theory is that fixing it is exposing a reference counting
	  error elsewhere, but I don't know where. (Or my analysis of this
	  being a problem could have been completely wrong in the first
	  place). Leave the comment in the code for so that someone may
	  investigate it again in the future. Also add a bit of doxygen to
	  transmit_provisional_response(). (closes issue ASTERISK-18979)

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Ensure ACK retransmit & hangup on non-200
	  response to INVITE When handling a non-2xx final response on an
	  INVITE transaction, we have to keep the transaction around after
	  we send an ACK in case we receive a retransmission of the
	  response so we can re-transmit the ACK, but also tear down the
	  ast_channel as soon as we transmit the ACK. Before this patch, we
	  could fail at both of these things. Calling
	  sip_alreadygone/needdestroy prevented us from keeping the
	  transaction up and retransmitting the ACK, and queueing
	  CONGESTION was not sufficient to cause the channel to be torn
	  down when originating calls via the CLI, for example. This patch
	  queues a hangup with CONGESTION instead of just queueing
	  CONGESTION for these responses and removes the sip_alreadygone
	  and sip_needdestroy calls from handle_response_invite on non-2xx
	  responses. It relies on the hangup calling sip_scheddestroy. For
	  more information, see section 17.1.1.1 of RFC 3261. (closes issue

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Create and initialize udptl only when
	  dialog negotiates for image media Prior to this patch, the udptl
	  struct was allocated and initialized when a dialog was associated
	  with a peer that supported T.38, when a new SIP channel was
	  allocated, or what an INVITE request was received. This resulted
	  in any dialog associated with a peer that supported T.38 having
	  udptl support assigned to it, including the UDP ports needed for
	  communication. This occurred even in non-INVITE dialogs that
	  would never send image media. This patch creates and initializes
	  the udptl structure only when the SDP for a dialog specifies that
	  image media is supported, or when Asterisk indicates through the
	  appropriate control frame that a dialog is to support T.38.

	  main/dsp.c: Replace direct access to channel name with accessor
	  functions There are many benefits to making the ast_channel an
	  opaque handle, from increasing maintainability to presenting ways
	  to kill masquerades. This patch kicks things off by taking things
	  a field at a time, renaming the field to
	  '__do_not_use_${fieldname}' and then writing setters/getters and
	  converting the existing code to using them. When all fields are
	  done, we can move ast_channel to a C file from channel.h and lop
	  off the '__do_not_use_'. This patch sets up
	  main/channel_interal_api.c to be the only file that actually
	  accesses the ast_channel's fields directly. The intent would be
	  for any API functions in channel.c to use the accessor functions.
	  No more monkeying around with channel internals. We should use
	  our own APIs. The interesting changes in this patch are the
	  addition of channel_internal_api.c, the moving of the AST_DATA
	  stuff from channel.c to channel_internal_api.c (note: the
	  AST_DATA stuff will have to be reworked to use accessor functions
	  when ast_channel is really opaque), and some re-working of the
	  way channel iterators/callbacks are handled so as to avoid
	  creating fake ast_channels on the stack to pass in matching data
	  by directly accessing fields (since "name" is a stringfield and
	  the fake channel doesn't init the stringfields, you can't use the
	  ast_channel_name_set() function). I went with
	  ast_channel_name(chan) for a getter, and
	  ast_channel_name_set(chan, name) for a setter. The majority of
	  the grunt-work for this change was done by writing a semantic
	  patch using Coccinelle ( http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/ ). Review:

	  MOH Prior to this patch, res_musiconhold existed at the same
	  module priority level as the timing sources that it depends on.
	  This would cause a problem when music on hold was reloaded, as
	  the timing source could be changed after res_musiconhold was
	  processed. This patch adds a new module priority level,
	  AST_MODPRI_TIMING, that the various timing modules are now loaded
	  at. This now occurs before loading other resource modules, such
	  that the timing source is guaranteed to be set prior to resolving
	  the timing source dependencies. (closes issue ASTERISK-17474)

	  we are spying on. The first is always necessary, but the others
	  are used only when specific options are passed to the ChanSpy
	  application (B, d, w, and W to be specific). When those flags are
	  not passed, neither of those audiohooks are ever sent frames, but

	* main/pbx.c, /, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h: Fix
	  extension state callback references in chan_sip. Chan_sip gives a
	  dialog reference to the extension state callback and assumes that
	  when ast_extension_state_del() returns, the callback cannot
	  happen anymore. Chan_sip then reduces the dialog reference count
	  associated with the callback. Recent changes (ASTERISK-17760)
	  have resulted in the potential for the callback to happen after
	  ast_extension_state_del() has returned. For chan_sip, this could
	  be very bad because the dialog pointer could have already been
	  destroyed. * Added ast_extension_state_add_destroy() so chan_sip
	  can account for the sip_pvt reference given to the extension
	  state callback when the extension state callback is deleted. *
	  Fix pbx.c awkward statecbs handling in
	  ast_extension_state_add_destroy() and handle_statechange() now
	  that the struct ast_state_cb has a destructor to call. * Ensure
	  that ast_extension_state_add_destroy() will never return -1 or 0
	  for a successful registration. * Fixed pbx.c statecbs_cmp() to
	  compare the correct information. The passed in value to compare
	  is a change_cb function pointer not an object pointer. * Make
	  pbx.c ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() not perform callbacks with
	  AST_EXTENSION_REMOVED with locks held. Chan_sip is notorious for
	  deadlocking when those locks are held during the callback. *
	  Removed unused lock declaration for the pbx.c store_hints list.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample, CHANGES: Default
	  to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ It is
	  possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
	  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a
	  request is sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via
	  header. In 1.4 and 1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was
	  nat=yes or nat=route and the other was either nat=no or
	  nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one was
	  nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no. In order to address
	  this problem, it was decided to switch the default behavior to
	  nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option and to
	  strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
	  possible. For more discussion of the issue, please see:

	  channels/sip/include/reqresp_parser.h: Don't treat a host:port
	  string as a domain The domain matching code prior to 1.8 used to
	  manually remove the port from the host:port string when
	  determining if an incoming request matched the list of domains.
	  When switching to the new parsing functions, the documentation
	  implied that the "domain" was being returned by these functions,
	  when instead it was returning the "hostport" as defined by RFC
	  3261. This led to confusion and resulted in 1.8+ rejecting an
	  incoming request from x.x.x.x:xxxxx when domain=x.x.x.x was set
	  in sip.conf. This patch renames the "domain" variables in the
	  parsing functions to "hostport" to more accurately describe what
	  it is that they are returning and also properly truncates the
	  resulting hostport strings when dealing with domain matching.

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/extconfig.conf.sample,
	  include/asterisk/config.h, main/config.c: Several fixes to the
	  chan_sip dynamic realtime peer/user lookup There were several
	  problems with the dynamic realtime peer/user lookup code. The
	  lookup logic had become rather hard to read due to lots of
	  incremental changes to the realtime_peer function. And, during
	  the addition of the sipregs functionality, several possibilities
	  for memory leaks had been introduced. The insecure=port matching
	  has always been broken for anyone using the sipregs family. And,
	  related, the broken implementation forced those using sipregs to
	  *still* have an ipaddr column on their sippeers table. Thanks
	  Terry Wilson for comprehensive testing and finding and fixing
	  unexpected behaviour from the multientry realtime call which
	  caused the realtime_peer to have a completely unused code path.
	  This changeset fixes the leaks, the lookup inconsistenties and
	  that you won't need an ipaddr column on your sippeers table
	  anymore (when you're using sipregs). Beware that when you're
	  using sipregs, peers with insecure=port will now start matching!

	  when adding extension to pattern match tree When an extension is

	  already in the tree but previously deleted, and the pattern was
	  at the end of a match, the findonly flag was not honored and the
	  extension would be erroneously undeleted. Additionaly, it was
	  discovered that an IAX2 peer could be unregistered via the CLI,
	  while at the same time it could be scheduled for unregistration
	  by Asterisk. The unregistration method now checks to see if the

	* /, apps/app_queue.c: Simplify queue membercount code Despite an
	  ominous sounding comment stating that membercount was for "logged
	  in" members only and thus we couldn't use ao2_container_count(),
	  I could not find a single place in the code where that seemed to
	  be accurate. The only time we decremented membercount was when we
	  were marking something dead or actually removing it. The only
	  places we incremented it were either after ao2_link(), or trying
	  to correct for having set it to 0 during a reload. In every case
	  where we were correcting the value, it seemed that we were trying
	  to make the count actually match what ao2_container_count() would
	  return. The only place I could find where we made a determination
	  about something being "logged in" or not, we didn't trust the
	  membercount, but instead looked at devicestate, paused, etc. This
	  patch removes membercount, replaces its use with
	  ao2_container_count, and manually adds the results of
	  ao2_container_count to a "membercount" field for ast_data queue
	  query results. This patch also would fix AST-676, but as it is
	  slightly riskier than the previously committed fix, the two

	  18 lines Fix spool handling to allow call files to be hardlinked
	  into place This fixes the inotify code to handle call files being
	  hardlinked into the spool directory. The smsq utility does this,
	  instead of rename(), to ensure that it cannot accidentally
	  overwrite an existing spool file. A rename() might do that, but
	  link() will definitely not. The inotify code had broken this,
	  because it would wait for an IN_CLOSE_WRITE event on the file...
	  which was never forthcoming, since it was never opened. Now we
	  look for IN_OPEN events following the IN_CREATE event, and only
	  wait for an IN_CLOSE_WRITE if the file was actually opened.

	* /, main/features.c, res/res_agi.c, include/asterisk/features.h:
	  Fix AGI exec Park to honor the Park application parameters. The
	  fix for ASTERISK-12715 and ASTERISK-12685 added a check for the
	  Park application because the channel needed to be masqueraded to
	  prevent a crash. Since the Park application now always
	  masquerades the channel into the parking lot, the special check
	  is no longer needed. The fix also resulted in AGI exec Park
	  attempting to double park the call and not honor the Park
	  application parameters. * Removed no longer necessary call to
	  ast_masq_park_call() by AGI exec for the Park application.
	  (Reverts -r146923) * Fix Park application to only return 0 or -1.
	  The AGI exec Park was causing broken pipe error messages because
	  the Park application returned 1 on successful park. (closes issue

	  r341486 | mnicholson | 2011-10-19 16:23:17 -0500 (Wed, 19 Oct
	  2011) | 18 lines Fix a performance regression introduced in
	  r325483. The regression was caused by a call to
	  ast_parse_device_state() in app_queue's ring_entry() function.
	  The ast_parse_device_state() function eventually calls
	  ast_channel_get_full() with a channel name prefix which causes it
	  to walk the channel list causing massive lock contention and slow
	  downs. This patch fixes the regression by removing the call to
	  ast_parase_device_state() which should be unnecessary. Queue
	  member device state should be maintained by device state events.
	  Some users have seen instances where busy agents were called when
	  they shouldn't have, which is the reason the call to
	  ast_parse_device_state() was added. That change appears to have
	  resolved that issue but also causes this performance regression.
	  There may still be issues with queue member status, and if so,
	  alternative methods should be investigated to resolve them.

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Add skinny version 17 protocol support.
	  Added some data to skinny packet structures to make compatible
	  with v17. Added protocolversion to device, set on registration
	  based on the version provided by device. v17 includes some
	  increased ip space for ip6. This patch increases ip space in the
	  packets but still only uses ip4. Some packet structures
	  duplicated (ip4 and ip6 types). ip4 type used unless version is
	  greater or equal to 17. Tested by snuff and myself on 7961 with
	  recent 8.5 firmware. Also tested compatible with old 7960 and
	  older 30VIPs.

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Increase SKINNY_MAX_PACKET and add some
	  logging. Increase SKINNY_MAX_PACKET to 2000 bytes to handle some
	  messages in v17 that are greater than the old 1000 bytes. Also
	  add some useful logging regarding packet and session handling. A
	  device (with protocol v17) was sending a packet with length
	  greater than 1000 which resulted in the TCP session being
	  destroyed and registration being retryed.

	* channels/chan_skinny.c: Fixed segfault on core stop gracefully.
	  There was an issue that the cap and confcap pointers for each
	  line and device were being memcpy'd so they all pointed to the
	  same ast_format_cap. On destroying, a segfault occured on the
	  second call to the same struct. skinny reload now works again as
	  well. Tested by snuff and myself.

	  | 30 lines Fix deadlock when using dummy channels. Dummy channels
	  created by ast_dummy_channel_alloc() should be destoyed by
	  ast_channel_unref(). Using ast_channel_release() needlessly grabs
	  the channel container lock and can cause a deadlock as a result.
	  * Analyzed use of ast_dummy_channel_alloc() and made use
	  ast_channel_unref() when done with the dummy channel. (Primary
	  reason for the reported deadlock.) * Made
	  app_dial.c:dial_exec_full() not call ast_call() holding any
	  channel locks. Chan_local could not perform deadlock avoidance
	  correctly. (Potential deadlock exposed by this issue. Secondary
	  reason for the reported deadlock since the held lock was part of
	  the deadlock chain.) * Fixed some uses of
	  ast_dummy_channel_alloc() not checking the returned channel
	  pointer for failure. * Fixed some potential chan=NULL pointer
	  usage in func_odbc.c. Protected by testing the bogus_chan value.
	  * Fixed needlessly clearing a 1024 char auto array when setting
	  the first char to zero is enough in manager.c:action_getvar().

	  is a bug - or architecture mistake - that has been in Asterisk
	  for a very long time. It was exposed by the AMI originate action
	  and possibly some other applications. Most channel drivers checks
	  if an extension exists BEFORE starting a pbx on an inbound call,
	  so most calls will not depend on this issue. Thanks everyone
	  involved in the review and on IRC and the mailing list for a

	  | 21 lines Fix for incorrect voicemail duration in external
	  notifications This patch fixes an issue where the voicemail
	  duration was being reported with a duration significantly less
	  than the actual sound file duration. Voicemails that contained
	  mostly silence were reporting the duration of only the sound in
	  the file, as opposed to the duration of the file with the
	  silence. This patch fixes this by having two durations reported
	  in the __ast_play_and_record family of functions - the
	  sound_duration and the actual duration of the file. The
	  sound_duration, which is optional, now reports the duration of
	  the sound in the file, while the actual full duration of the file
	  is reported in the duration parameter. This allows the voicemail
	  applications to use the sound_duration for minimum duration
	  checking, while reporting the full duration to external parties
	  if the voicemail is kept. (issue ASTERISK-2234) (closes issue

	  | 36 lines Fix crashes in ast_rtcp_write(). This patch addresses
	  crashes related to RTCP handling. The backtraces just show a
	  crash in ast_rtcp_write() where it appears that the RTP instance
	  is no longer valid. There is a race condition with scheduled RTCP
	  transmissions and the destruction of the RTP instance. This patch
	  utilizes the fact that ast_rtp_instance is a reference counted
	  object and ensures that it will not get destroyed while a
	  reference is still around due to scheduled RTCP transmissions.
	  RTCP transmissions are scheduled and executed from the chan_sip
	  scheduler context. This scheduler context is processed in the SIP
	  monitor thread. The destruction of an RTP instance occurs when
	  the associated sip_pvt gets destroyed (which happens when the
	  sip_pvt reference count reaches 0). However, the SIP monitor
	  thread is not the only thread that can cause a sip_pvt to get
	  destroyed. The sip_hangup function, executed from a channel
	  thread, also decrements the reference count on a sip_pvt and
	  could cause it to get destroyed. While this is being changed
	  anyway, the patch also removes calling ast_sched_del() from
	  within the RTCP scheduler callback. It's not helpful. Simply
	  returning 0 prevents the callback from being rescheduled. (closes
	  issue ASTERISK-18570) Related issues that look like they are the

	  observed in a load testing environment that involved the use of
	  the res_ais module. I observed some crashes where the event
	  delivery callback would get called, but the length parameter
	  incidcating how much data there was to read was 0. The code
	  assumed (with good reason I would think) that if this callback
	  got called, there was an event available to read. However, if the
	  rare case that there's nothing there, catch it and return instead
	  of blowing up. More specifically, the change always ensure that
	  the size of the received event in the cluster is always big
	  enough to be a real ast_event. Review:

	  9 lines Prevent IAX2 from getting IPv6 addresses via DNS IAX2
	  does not support IPv6 and getting such addresses from DNS can
	  cause error messages on the remote end involving bad IPv4 address
	  casts in the presence of IPv6/IPv4 tunnels. This patch ensures
	  that IAX2 will not encounter IPv6 addresses via DNS queries.

	  | 23 lines Updated SIP 484 handling; added Incomplete control
	  frame When a SIP phone uses the dial application and receives a
	  484 Address Incomplete response, if overlapped dialing is enabled
	  for SIP, then the 484 Address Incomplete is forwarded back to the
	  SIP phone and the HANGUPCAUSE channel variable is set to 28.
	  Previously, the Incomplete application dialplan logic was
	  automatically triggered; now, explicit dialplan usage of the
	  application is required. Additionally, this patch adds a new
	  AST_CONTOL_FRAME type called AST_CONTROL_INCOMPLETE. If a channel
	  driver receives this control frame, it is an indication that the
	  dialplan expects more digits back from the device. If the device
	  supports overlap dialing it should attempt to notify the device
	  that the dialplan is waiting for more digits; otherwise, it can
	  handle the frame in a manner appropriate to the channel driver.

	  | 18 lines Create a local alias for ast_odbc_clear_cache. As a
	  function pointer, the reference has to be resolved at load time
	  irrespective of the RTLD_LAZY flag. Creating a local alias solves
	  this problem, because the structure is initialized with that
	  local function pointer, while the actual function can remain
	  lazily linked until runtime. The reason why this is important is
	  because we lazily load function references during the module
	  loading process, in order to obtain priority values for each
	  module, ensuring that modules are loaded in the correct order.
	  Previous to this change, when this module was initially loaded,
	  the module loader would emit a symbol resolution error, because
	  of the above requirement. Closes ASTERISK-18399 (reported by

	  | 43 lines Call pickup race leaves orphaned channels or crashes.
	  Multiple users attempting to pickup a call that has been forked
	  to multiple extensions either crashes or fails a masquerade with
	  a "bad things may happen" message. This is the scenario that is
	  causing all the grief: 1) Pickup target is selected 2) target is
	  marked as being picked up in ast_do_pickup() 3) target is
	  unlocked by ast_do_pickup() 4) app dial or queue gets a chance to
	  hang up losing calls and calls ast_hangup() on target 5) SINCE A
	  MASQUERADE HAS NOT BEEN SETUP YET BY ast_do_pickup() with
	  ast_channel_masquerade(), ast_hangup() completes successfully and
	  the channel is no longer in the channels container. 6)
	  ast_do_pickup() then calls ast_channel_masquerade() to schedule
	  the masquerade on the dead channel. 7) ast_do_pickup() then calls
	  ast_do_masquerade() on the dead channel 8) bad things happen
	  while doing the masquerade and in the process ast_do_masquerade()
	  puts the dead channel back into the channels container 9) The
	  "orphaned" channel is visible in the channels list if a crash
	  does not happen. This patch does the following: * Made
	  ast_hangup() set AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE on a successfully hung-up
	  channel and not release the channel lock until that has happened.
	  * Made __ast_channel_masquerade() not setup a masquerade if
	  either channel has AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE set. * Fix chan_agent misuse
	  of AST_FLAG_ZOMBIE since it would no longer work. (closes issue

	  | 26 lines Outgoing BRI calls fail when using Asterisk 1.8 with
	  HA8, HB8, and B410P cards. France Telecom brings layer 2 and
	  layer 1 down on BRI lines when the line is idle. When layer 1
	  goes down Asterisk cannot make outgoing calls and the HA8 and HB8
	  cards also get IRQ misses. The inability to make outgoing calls
	  is because the line is in red alarm and Asterisk will not make
	  calls over a line it considers unavailable. The IRQ misses for
	  the HA8 and HB8 card are because the hardware is switching clock
	  sources from the line which just brought layer 1 down to internal
	  timing. There is a DAHDI option for the B410P card to not tell
	  Asterisk that layer 1 went down so Asterisk will allow outgoing
	  calls: "modprobe wcb4xxp teignored=1". There is a similar DAHDI
	  option for the HA8 and HB8 cards: "modprobe wctdm24xxp
	  bri_teignored=1". Unfortunately that will not clear up the IRQ
	  misses when the telco brings layer 1 down. * Add layer 2
	  persistence option to customize the layer 2 behavior on BRI PTMP
	  lines. The new option has three settings: 1) Use libpri default
	  layer 2 setting. 2) Keep layer 2 up. Bring layer 2 back up when
	  the peer brings it down. 3) Leave layer 2 down when the peer
	  brings it down. Layer 2 will be brought up as needed for outgoing
	  calls. JIRA AST-598 ........ ................

	  Currently, logger only prints an error message to stderr when it

	  would silently fail on each call to the Asterisk logger. (closes

	  channels/chan_iax2.c, main/astobj2.c: astobj2: Avoid using
	  temporary objects + ao2_find() with OBJ_POINTER. There is a
	  fairly common pattern making its way through the code base where
	  we put a temporary object on the stack so we can call ao2_find()
	  with OBJ_POINTER. The purpose is so that it can be passed into
	  the object hash function. However, this really seems like a hack
	  and potentially error prone. This patch is a first stab at
	  approach to avoid having to do that. It adds a new flag, OBJ_KEY,
	  which can be used instead of OBJ_POINTER in these situations.
	  Then, the hash function can know whether it was given an object
	  or some custom data to hash. The patch also changes some uses of
	  ao2_find() for iax2_user and iax2_peer objects to reflect how
	  OBJ_KEY would be used. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

	  17 lines Fixes some voicemail forwarding behavior based around
	  prepend mode. Formerly, prepend forwarding would have the user
	  record a message with no useful prompt and an expectation for the
	  user to push a button on the phone when finished recording. If a
	  length of silence was detected instead, the recording would be
	  canceled and the user would re-enter the voicemail forwarding
	  menu. Subsequent time-outs in prepend recording would also bug
	  out in the sense that they would write over the original message
	  and get sent to the recipient regardless of whether they timed
	  out or were accepted. This patch fixes this issue and adds a
	  prompt which will be played after a timeout informing the user
	  that they needed to press a button. Currently, the sound files
	  that we have are somewhat inadquate for this, so after the call
	  we simply have Allison say "Please try again. Then press pound."
	  which actually relies on two separate sound files. Just one would
	  be more appropriate. reporter: Vlad Povorozniuc Review:

	  | 48 lines Deadlocks dealing with dialplan hints during reload.
	  There are two remaining different deadlocks reported dealing with
	  dialplan hints. The deadlock in ASTERISK-17666 is caused by
	  invalid locking order in ast_remove_hint(). The hints container
	  must be locked before the hint object. The deadlock in
	  ASTERISK-17760 is caused by a catch-22 situation in
	  handle_statechange(). The deadlock is caused by not having the
	  conlock before calling the watcher callbacks. Unfortunately,
	  having that lock causes a different deadlock as reported in
	  ASTERISK-16961. * Fixed ast_remove_hint() locking order. * Made
	  handle_statechange() no longer call the watcher callbacks holding
	  any locks that matter. * Made hint ao2 destructor do the watcher
	  callbacks for extension deactivation to guarantee that they get
	  called. * Fixed hint reference leak in ast_add_hint() if the
	  callback container constructor failed. * Fixed hint reference
	  leak in complete_core_show_hint() for every hint it found for CLI
	  tab completion. * Adjusted locking in
	  ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() for safety. * Added
	  context_merge_lock to prevent ast_merge_contexts_and_delete() and
	  handle_statechange() from interfering with each other. * Fixed
	  ast_change_hint() not taking into account that the extension is
	  used for the hash key. (closes issue ASTERISK-17666) Reported by:
